1430022,"2003 Craigellachie 16 Year Old ""Old Particular"" K&L Exclusive Single Sherry Butt Cask Strength Speyside Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) (Pre-Arrival)","One of the most distinctive malts in all of Scotland. Craigellachie utilizes worm tubs with a very low copper content that, in combination with very long fermentation times, contributes to a rare and desirable sulfurous trait in whisky . The end result is a pungent aroma that when young is often described as meaty or like boiled cabbage, but when matured works its way into complex sweet fragrances such as pineapple and other tropical fruits and floral notes. These beautiful flavors offer aromatics in combination with palate weight and make Craigellachie a prized malt for blenders and single malt enthusiasts alike. When in combination with sherried wood, there is nothing else like it. The tropical flavors mingle with the nuttiness of the sherry to make a whisky unmatched in flavor, weight, and aromatics. These rare casks typically command astronomical prices, but as always, thanks to our long standing direct relationships in Scotland, we’ve been able to secure a cask or two that offer unparalleled value in the single malt category._NA"
1388656,"Lagavulin 9 Year Old ""Game of Thrones House Lannister"" Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) (Previously $70)","Lagavulin at an odd age, representing House Lannister and showcasing its lion sigil. The nose is floral, with rose hips, toffee, and fragrant peat notes. Full on the palate, with toffee apples, cinnamon, earthy peat, and smoked haddock in salted butter. The smoked fish combines with fennel in the lengthy finish.Part of Diageo's line of eight single malt whiskies to commemorate the eighth and final season of HBO's hit television series,""Game of Thrones"", that's based on the series of novels, ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", by George R.R. Martin. The Lannisters are known for their meticulousness and tenacity, traits also embodied by the legendary distillery Lagavulin. Taste note: ""Lagavulin 9 Year Old is a roaring single malt that leaves an intensely smoky flavour in every sip. The golden liquid recalls the Lannisters’ riches and comes from being exclusively matured in first fill ex-Bourbon casks. The nose is characteristic of Lagavulin and bursts with sweet smoke, with a slightly zestier, maritime scent than other expressions. On the palate it opens with smoky, caramelised banana, burnt marshmallow and vanilla, fading into a salted caramel finish.""_NA"
1494702,"1995 Aberlour 25 Year Old ""Old Particular"" K&L Exclusive Single Hogshead Cask Strength Speyside Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) (Pre-Arrival)","The gorgeous little distillery at the entrance of the tiny town of the same name has quietly become one of the Scotch-loving world's darlings. The distillery, owned by blending giant Chivas Brothers , was built in 1879 and features two 21 thousand-liter wash stills and a pair each of spirits stills, 20 and 15 thousand liters. The distillery's name means ""mouth of the babbling brook,"" and indeed a stream meanders next to the distillery, but the distillery's water comes from Ben Rinnes like many of the other distilleries around the famous mountain. We've never been offered a barrel of Aberlour, much less one of such astonishing age. While the distillery itself has been focused on NAS bottlings like their popular A'Bunadh series, the older expressions have become extremely rare. This single hogshead was selected not only for the incredible provenance and rarity, but also its extreme deliciousness. Unlike many modern Aberlours, which have become synonymous with hardcore sherry, this is much more nuanced and idiosyncratic. While by no means a value buy, it does represent a malt that is otherwise unobtainable at nearly any price and its inherent quality and unique character easily merit the price of entry. Only 184 bottles came out of this old hogshead. It was bottled at cask strength without chill-filteration or coloring of any kind._NA"
1215038,"Suntory ""Hibiki Japanese Harmony"" Japanese Whisky (750ml)","The newest blended whisky offering from Hibiki is burnished gold in the glass and has a bold aroma that mixes vanilla, fresh pear and a hint of smoke. The smokiness comes forward at the first sip, wrapping around a core of oak and vanilla custard and finishing long, with a mouthwatering bitter chocolate note.Poised and complex, with typically lifted fruitiness: strawberry ice cream, pineapple, peach, balanced by delicate oak, bamboo shoot-like delicacy, then lemon. The palate is more rounded than that very forward nose, with toffee notes adding some weight. A touch of smoke comes along in the mid-palate, before fruits and caramelized coffee biscuits. Water allows the flavors to flood the palate. Exemplary blending skills and classically Hibiki.You can’t be a Japanese whisky enthusiast without having noticed that there’s a shortage of the stuff. What once was readily available is now hard to find. What once was affordable now costs various bodily limbs. It is due to more than a fad. The best Japanese whisky is remarkable stuff, and none are better than the top single malts from Suntory, Yamazaki, Hakushu and the blended whisky Hibiki. Hibiki comes in 12-, 17- and 21-year-old expressions, but even the youngest of these is now allocated. Harmony, the newest release, carries no age statement, indicating that it contains younger whiskies than other bottlings. Nevertheless, this is a welcome concession, with Suntory’s classic sense of balance, nuance and delicacy.The newest incarnation of Suntory's hugely popular Hibiki series, this time without an age statement attached. The same soft, mellow, vanilla-laden flavor is still here, however. It's a true harmony of pure Hibiki flavor._This whisky contains single malt from both Yamazaki and Hakushu, so there are chops to this blend. Toasted grain, vanilla syrup, new wood, and light tropical fruit notes on the nose with just a touch of spice to keep things playful. The palate has more caramel and honey characteristics balanced by more tingly spice. There's a great salinity here as well with a gentle medicinality and robust malt character.
            |
                I was particularly excited to try the 'Hibiki Harmony' since it seems all of the Japanese whisky's are becoming so popular they sell out before most people get a crack at them. There is a definite sherry note present on the nose, and the palate is light, yet rich simultaneously. The Japanese whisky's generally seem to show as more elegant and prettier than those from other countries and this one fits that description perfectly. Though we did receive good stock this time, it won't last with the following the 'Harmony' has. Don't miss this opportunity because it probably won't come again and it's only going to become harder to acquire. 
            |
                If you haven't had Hibiki Harmony recently, you must retry it. In all honesty, it's not something we've opened for the staff here in a long time since it is so tightly allocated and sells out so quickly. It just wasn't necessary. With our most recent drop of one of the most asked for Japanese whiskies on the market, I decided it was time to make sure the staff all knew what exactly we had. I must say, I was blown away by the richness in particular. The flavors are a delight, crisp apple, fresh stone fruits, a touch of piquant pepper and a surprising amounts of vanilla and caramel. The palate has much more weight, presumably from a higher malt content, than I recall. It coats the tongue, but is never heavy. The finish is clean and bright and decidedly entices you to have another sip. We spend most of the year out of stock on this whisky just sadly telling customers, ""no, it's not available."" Today, we are sitting flush and want to let everyone know it's here. The trick is, with the insane popularity of all true Japanese whisky, it won't be here for long."
1421728,"2005 Laphroaig 13 Year Old ""Chieftain's"" K&L Exclusive Single Sherry Butt Cask Strength Unchillfiltered Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","The magical distillery on the south shore of Islay, like all south shore distillers, is quite unlike any other. But Laphroaig has a certain place in the hearts of the hardest core peat lovers. They're the last distiller down there to malt a portion of their barley on site. Their complex system of tiny stills create the most peculiar and enticing peated spirit in the world. The quality and consistency of their casks is second to none. But over the last decade, what was once a staple in the independent bottling repertoire has completely disappeared. Laphroaig is simply not selling casks any longer. And when we do find casks they're usually in very inactive hogsheads and declassified to their trade name, ""Williamson."" Now that's not a huge problem because Laphroaig always tastes good, but bottlers can't replace even those few casks the prices have gone absolutely bonkers. Signatory recently bottled a sister cask those we sold here just three years ago for $200, Laphroaig from the Fall of 1997, for $700. And by God those bottles sell. But a beautiful butt for a not completely abhorrent price, we jumped all over it. Thank the Lord of the Isles that we did, as it's a complete and utter masterpiece. Some purists askew the idea of Laphroaig in active sherry, but much of the experience is limited to low proof distillery bottlings and finishes. It's truly a stupendous find and going to be one of those casks that people remember for years to come. Collectors and drinkers alike take note_Laphroaig very infrequently releases anything new, let alone a single cask of  something new. Fans of the classic Laphroaig style will not be disappointed here, but will also be pleased to find new tastes and expressions. Rich texture and creamy peat notes get a kick from a slight jalapeno pepper spice in the back.  This extremely limited and special release could retail for much higher given its scarcity. Lucky for us it doesn't.  
            |
                Every so often time stops, a dizzying array of pieces fall into place, and you're left with one special moment. Such is drinking this masterpiece. Tragically, Chieftain's is going away. One of the most storied and high quality bottlers in Scotland has pulled out all of the stops for it's swan song. Aged to perfection this cask toes the line perfectly between every facet of Laphroaig. It's equally salty, malty, fruity, floral, and smoky in that amazing way that only Laphroaig can be. In addition there is a splendid cigar box spice provided by an amazing barrel of the highest quality and perfectly matched to the whisky. Not overpowering, it is just robust enough to blend seamlessly with everything on offer from the spirit. My best Laphroaig drinking experience was having John Campbell, Distillery Manager, walk me through the classic 10 year, a single cask bourbon barrel roughly 14 years old, and the legendary 30 year. The insights those 3 carefully chosen whiskies provided into the soul of Laphroaig is something I will never forget. It set off a personal and more indepth study of the whisky behind the smoke and iodine that the distillery is so famous for. This one cask highlights the traits that makes the the malt from this special place so complete and such a rarity in the flavor spectrum without giving up that core profile. Tasting this malt and then going back to Laphraoig 10 will forever unlock for the drinker the often overlooked and underappreciated glory of the classic expression.
            |
                Since barrels of single malt age differently and produce a range of flavors it is always a treat to taste something and see the variation on a theme  from the regular releases.This tasty barrel is very interesting and fantastic. The nose has a burst of smoke that is almost pretty ( a word not usually associated with Laphroaig) with toasty undertones. In the mouth it is classic Laprhoaig with smoke , iodine, salt and malt. With water it opens up and becomes softer. There is a long finish with an interesting touch of spice.This single barrel is unique and interesting.
            |
                If my family drank, this is a bottle I’d take with me to our holiday dinners. This bottle screams autumn with notes of ume plum, burnt caramel, oak spice, and cinnamon graham crackers on the nose. The palate is fatty, savory, and sweet and I can imagine it going perfectly with turkey and stuffing. It’s warm and inviting, I just want to cuddle up with it next to a fire and look longingly at the glass.
            |
                Laphroaig is one of those incredible things that is both polarizing and unifying, sometimes between the same people at the same exact time. I personally adore almost everything I taste from this special distillery. Yes there are some underwhelming distillery bottlings that might feel a bit over manipulated, but the whisky is never ever bad. The great heights that can be achieved by Laphroaig are truly unbelievable. And uniquely, some of the very best from this special distillery are not even very old. The very best Laphroaig I've ever had the great pleasure of tasting are no more than 10 years old, given they'd have been distilled 40 or 50 years ago, but the fact remains that Laphroaig is often more special in its youth. For years Laphroaig has felt like a bit of a secret that you weren't sure you wanted to share with everyone you know. Particularly that was true of the special single casks that we'd come across in warehouses and whisky shops throughout Scotland. But in the current climate, where the distillery itself has no need or use for trading or brokering excess production, what was once a special secret to find and share is now an endangered species completely. So when we get offered casks like this we expect them to be unfathomably expensive. But even if this were twice the price I'd still have bought it. This is that perfectly idiosyncratic Laphroaig, apt to have you disagreeing with yourself. Deep wafting peat, a mix of bitter herbs, salty ocean trawler, candied apricots and diesel engine. Old leather furniture, Seville oranges, not quite tropical, but not so severe as it might be. On the palate a building sweetness envelopes the powerful smoke as it wafts toward the olfactory system. Dark chocolate, salted plums, menthol and magic. A total dream and a secret that deserves to be kept."

1499778,"1997 Hector Macbeth (Glenfiddich) 23 Year Old ""Hepburn's Choice"" K&L Exclusive Single Sherry Butt Finish Cask Strength Blended Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) (Pre-Arrival)","One of the original teaspooned malts here at K&L that longtime customers may already be familiar with is Hector Macbeth. While nearly all of this year's blended malts had another distillers spirit dropped into it right before bottling, this was teaspooned at the time of production by the original maker with the intention of being sold off to the independent market. This is really how teaspooning came to be a thing in the first place. Blue chip distilleries, like Glenfiddich in this case, don’t want a bunch of people trading on their name. They do however, still want to sell casks into the blending market to raise quick cash. While we don’t know what they put into the cask in this case  we do know that it tastes just like you’d expect sherry finished Glenfiddich at cask strength to taste. If you’ve ever had the excellent Glenfiddich 15 Year Sherry Solera bottling and thought, 'I wish this was full proof,' this is the malt for you. The extra 8 years of aging doesn’t hurt either._The excellent Hector Macbeth has now become a staple on our shelves each year. It keeps getting older and more delicious, but we've managed to keep the price more or less the same. This year, things are a bit different. We started with the same well aged famous Speyside (teaspooned at birth), two of the standard hogsheads worth. We dumped those two barrels into a sherry butt. Now this wasn't any old sherry butt. Typically, when Scotch producers finish their products they'll use what are called ""seasoned"" sherry casks. These are created expressly for use in Scotch production and include the minimum required aging in  Jerez before being dumped and shipped to Scotland. It is truly the cask that is the commodity in this system. But in this case, the Laing's used an ex-sherry butt that previously held unpeated single malt for many years. The whisky spent three full years maturing in this gorgeous old barrel. This is pretty unusual for finishing and while it doesn't impart the same fresh wine flavors as the seasoned casks, there's still plenty of life in this old butt. The resulting whisky is less a finish and more a secondary maturation. Jim McEwan would have called it ACE'd, additional cask enhancement in his Murray McDavid, which he reserved for products finished for longer than a year typically. It was bottled exclusively for K&L. The nose is packed for of dark roasted malt, deep dark cocoa, wild honey and maple syrup. On the palate the great high proof doesn't overwhelm at all and even with a descent splash of water it still offers tons of texture and richness. The gorgeous maltiness of the spirit here is not totally masked by the sherry and I'm grateful for that as there's no question that this exceptional distillery is at its best unfiltered and cask strength. Expect some dried fruits and subtle exotic spice on the palate with the malt and sherry balancing out nicely for a long nutty finish. I think this will be many people's surprise favorite since it ticks so many boxes and the benefit of finishing here is that we have a nice supply of it for now. Of course if there real serious drinkers start bunkering it like the last one - even this relatively full sherry butt will be empty before we know."

The palate is relatively dry, with hints of cocoa, leather, stone fruit and clove. Adding water coaxes out more vanilla sweetness and hints of citrus, exiting dry and spiced.This was aged in a mixture of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks, followed by a final spell of marrying in wooden tuns. Dried fruits, dark chocolate, figs, and cinnamon on the nose. The palate yields rich caramel and toffee-apple notes, plus ginger, cloves, and medium sherry. More dried fruits, cookies, and a sprinkling of allspice in the slightly smoky, medium to long finish.The Glenfiddich 18 Year Old has a delightfully rich aroma reminiscent of ripe orchard fruit, spiced apples and robust oakiness.

1364563,"Kaiyo ""The Peated"" Mizunara Oak Japanese Whisky (750ml)","This is utterly unique; made from imported Scottish peated malt, it spends 2 years in madeira casks, then 6 years in mizunara casks. Light, clean, fruity refreshment: apple, white grape, lingering cigar smoke, coconut macaroons, and ample Japanese oak influence. Apple and watermelon flavors, developing a more sugary fruitiness of Life Savers hard candy, all brushed with gentle spice and a swish of smoke. Jonny McCormickKaiyo is a negotiant bottler started by a drinks group led by former Asahi employee Mr. Watanabe. He was able to purchase ""teaspooned"" malt whisky barrels from an unnamed Japanese whisky supplier via his connections in the industry . For those unfamiliar with the legend of Japanese Mizunara oak, it's become heralded in the whisky world both for the exotic flavors of incense, sandalwood, and coconut it passes along to the spirit as well as its expense. Difficult to cooper and notoriously inefficient as a vessel, editions of Yamazaki and Bowmore aged in Mizunara wood have sold at four figure prices, making the Kaiyo whiskies seem like a steal in comparison. You get an exotic note of tea and faint orange peel on the nose of the standard Kaiyo edition, but the soft and rather delicate palate brings more of the vanilla and oak character. The spices come out on the finish with lots of pepper and oolong. It's very Japanese in its restraint, graceful from front to back without any serious peaks or valleys. And of course, this bottling is beautifully peated!_Yippy-Kaiyo!
This new peated expression from Kaiyo maintains the bottler’s search for balanced whiskies and graceful maturation techniques. The delicate wood grain of the Mizunara casks used for aging lends both flavor and finesse to this tasty spirit. At 92 proof with no chill filtration and the peat, this is a full-flavored dram, but no individual component overwhelms. The peat is definitely present, but it stays soft on the nose with subtle elements of chile spice with a particular restrained oak note along with floral scents. That oak comes up first on the palate but is quickly followed by the peat, maintaining the balance present in the nose. There’s a lovely vanilla cream and honey sweetness that fades into a very dry finish of that gentle lingering peat.
            |
                This instantly skyrocketed to my favorite of the 3 Kaiyo bottlings. The peat is just big enough to amp up everything else about the whisky but not overpower it. The first thing you notice is the incredible fruitiness of the spirit. Green apples stand out in a big way. The peat comes in a little bit later and takes the edge off of the sweet fruit. Salted caramel, sea spray, and other salty notes also hit it big on the nose. Perhaps this comes from the long ocean voyage the whiskey makes before bottling. The rocking of the ship and the intense humidity, pressure, and temperature changes from this trip allows for maximum contact and interaction between the juice and the world famous Mizunara Oak. The palate comes through with more cereal notes and lets the malt shine. The fruit dives into a more complex tropical set of flavors. Tons of coconut, pineapple, and sweet florals come out to play. The finish is quite long and presents really clean with just a graceful wafting smoke. All around a spectacular dram.
            |
                I tasted this product with and without water. I suggest a splash of water because it really opens it up and helps show what an tasty and interesting treat this is.There nice smoke notes in the nose. In the mouth it is soft, and like most Japanese malts on the light side. It is the unique and complex spice flavors that set this single malt apart from the crowd. Delicious and seductive."

In 2018 it re-emerged with a new recipe, tweaked by master distiller Rachel Barrie. As before, a mixture of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks has taken care of the aging process, and the result is one of the very best sherried single malts of its age on the market. The distillery’s characteristic spice, fruit, and chocolate notes are here in abundance, merging seamlessly and with satisfying complexity to create a great after-dinner dram.The 15 year is finally back! After ceasing production in 2015, the Revival has returned. Aged in PX and Olorosso casks the malt is classic, rich, and unctous. It's full of honeyed tones, chocolate, and dried fruits.

John Campbell, Laphroaig distillery manager, said: “Laphroaig 16-year-old is the perfect illustration of how our rich whiskies mellow as they mature. Whilst this expression carries the iconic smoke of Laphroaig, this is married with sweeter notes of honey and caramel, creating a remarkable dram that’s perfect for the long evenings of late summer and into cosier nights of autumn.

They sport some of the longest fermentation times in all of Scotland and some of the slowest stills as well. These longer processes coupled with a massive amount of available copper lead to an unabashedly fruity and super clean spirit. The real magic of Glengoyne is in the fact that it retains enough stuffing to play perfectly with heavy sherry influences. Indeed the distillery bottlings nearly all focus on sherry maturation. This particular exclusive bottling from Old Particular has been finished in PX sherry leading to the very best of both worlds.

1422030,"Braes of Glenlivet (Braeval) 29 Year Old ""Sovereign Wax Top"" K&L Exclusive Single Barrel Cask Strength Single Malt Whisky (750ml)","The young Braeval distillery, originally known as Braes of Glenlivet, is a relative newcomer to the Speyside whisky scene. Construction began in 1973 and the plant was designed as a workhorse malt for the Chivas Brands . The location of the distillery is not far from their namesake, Glenlivet, and the name translates to the 'hillside in the valley of the river Livet.' The name was originally intended to be an example of how to properly express the geographic location, which many other distilleries used at the time, but Seagram's had trademarked. Ultimately, they would win the right to use the word Glenlivet on their other distilleries' labels exclusively and therefore renamed this distillery appropriately. Always considered a high quality base malt for the blenders, Braeval was promptly shut down after its sale to Pernod Ricard in 2001. Thankfully, they reopened the plant in 2008. This old cask bears the name the distillate had when it came off the still almost 30 years ago and represents one of the finest examples of the rare distillate we've ever come across. Even at this age the malt remains fully intact without any semblance of degradation. Extremely complex and chock full of classic Speyside aromatics coupled with a bevy of unique flavors. This is truly the finest old Braeval we've ever come across and a must-have for anyone looking for proper old Speyside malt at an altogether reasonable price._We often over look Braeval because it's not the sexiest malt. The workhouse malt for many blenders has a relatively good reputation, but has never been released as a single malt so consumers tend ignore it. But anytime we see it listed by it's original trade name we must take note because that means it's old! This is unquestionably the best Braes of Glenlivet I've ever had (admittedly I haven't had too many), but even beyond the oddity of seeing a cask of this stuff at this age, it's simply delicious malt. It has everything I want from a great old Speyside malt and much more. The nose starts with an absolutely gorgeous dark maltiness. Behind that sweet syrup of stone fruits, complex herbs, bitter barks and mint. Despite the high proof and not atypical of very old malt, this one improves much more with air than water. Even a drop of water seems to draw some astringency out. But if you keep adding you'll find it goes full circle into the pretty peaches and herbal tea thing we started at. That said, I'd recommend not touching this one with water if you can handle it. On the palate, tons of bold malty flavors, growing influence of the mint and dried herbs taking over. Hints of fruit and citrus remain, but they're thinly spread across a slice of rustic country bread, sprinkled in salt and mint. A truly exciting and almost profound little malt, just remember, NO WATER!
            |
                Crazy spices dominate the palate. All spice, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg just to name a few. It's intense and pretty all at the same time. It's not often the first thing that comes to mind on a nearly 30 year old whisky is zip, but this has a piquant zest and tingle to it that makes it feel alive. The Braes of Glenlivet, as it was known (today, simply Braeval), sits very near its more famous brother, The Glenlivet. While the two facilities share a style, the Braes seem to sport more of a rich mid palate, although to be fair, it's not exactly an apples to apples comparison as a comparatively old Glenlivet will cost you a small fortune."

1486830,2008 Highland Park 10 Year Old K&L Exclusive Cask #7774 Refill Sherry Hogshead Cask Strength Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml),"Another gorgeous cask of Highland Park that was bottled exclusively for K&L Wine Merchants. This one is equally special to the European oak hogshead that we also received this year, but completely different in character. The excellent malt coming out of Kirkwall is renowned worldwide for its quality, but many don't realize that Highland Park is one of a handful of Scottish distillers that continue to utilize the wildly inefficient floor maltings. The tradeoff for losing capacity to floor maltings is a malt of great character and complexity. In addition, the extremely unique Orkney peat is used to dry that barley, which one of the main reasons for Highland Park's distinctive flavor profile. Between 20% to 30% of the hand-malted barley goes into every batch of Highland Park, resulting in a lightly peated whisky that, when coupled with the high quantity of active sherry casks, means the whisky isn't perceived as particularly peaty to most palates. And while Highland Park does produce small amounts of whisky that are 100% hand malted, mostly as blending components for special releases, it's rare to find a single cask that exhibits the qualities of that special Orkney peat more clearly, despite it being blended with at least 70% of unmalted barley. This refill hogshead almost certainly held malt in it for a very long time before being refilled in 2008. Very dark for a refill, and the resulting spirit is the closest we've come to the ""old"" style Highland Park that we love so well._This is the sexiest example of Highland Park we've ever seen. Power and grace abound. While the word's ""First Fill Sherry"" adorning the title of our other HP cask gets a lot of blood pumping - it's the elegance of this refill cask that stands out. It's certainly not lacking in power - it's a beastly dram at 61.6% ABV - but it's supple and balanced beyond belief. The rich mahogany meets burnt amber color looks like it should be a first fill sherry cask, but ""refill hogshead"" is printed right on the label. The nose is a cornucopia of orange peel, cocoa nibs, fresh cut heather, crisp apple slices, fig marmalade, and a hint of smoky bacon. The palate has what you get when elegance and balance meet power: tension. It's alive and kicking ass, but holding it on your mouth is a serene experience. The finish last for minutes. At first the smoke fills your senses and that gives way to much more floral and candied notes. After a good long while it resolves into the finest of dark chocolate and fresh citrus zest with a touch of coffee. A beautiful performance that you can repeat every night. At least until it's gone.

                It's extremely infrequent that we find a cask at this age that shows so much complexity. While the 12 year old cask that we also bottled this year had the density and power unlike any we've seen previously, this cask has a depth and nuance that isn't at all available in the 12 year. The casks is much more inline with the way I remember Highland Park once was rather than the more bold and forward offerings we regularly see today. With that in mind, this is by no means a subtle whisky. It's got character to burn and it's DEFINITELY on the smokey side of HP. let's taste! Color: Tawny. Nose: The nose isn't at all peaty per say, but it's definitely smoke-y. A perfect example of the distinction of those to flavors. Leather, mesquite, bacon, hints of diesel engine, old cigar box and roasted cloves. Behind a touches of black fruit and pepper. Palate: Here is that AWESOME Orkney peat! Right up front and travelling straight through the palate. It's not the iodine peat but the flaming heather and earthy peat, framed perfectly with nutty sherry, dark fruit and woodsy spice. With water the nose transforms and offers a big burnt orange peel and candied citrus. Subtle mossy notes allude to the smoke coming on the palate. Now we're talking! It's very sweet and smokey now. Softening on the spice and bringing more dried fruits. This one is awesome right out of the bottle, but comes together perfectly with a splash of water. WOW, I'm so in love with this styel."

1485015,"1995 Tormore 22 Year Old ""Munros"" K&L Exclusive Cask Strength Unchillfiltered Island Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","The lovely small batch bottlings in the ""Munros"" line up are selected by the small Glasgow Whisky Company and represent some of the best values in single malt scotch today. This small outfit has become an increasingly important player in the sale and bottling of small scale lots of high quality Scotch. The Munros line is a reference to Scotland's 282 mountains over 3000 feet. Explorers across the UK had long considered climbing each peak a rite of passage and likewise the great malts represent the heights of achievement in the eyes of whisky lovers across the world. This exceptional expression of the famous Speyside distillery, Glen Grant, was distilled entirely on July 26th, 1995. Filled into refill American oak ex-bourbon barrels, it's been allowed more than 22 years to mature in the cool climate of northern Scotland. Bottled on the 30th of October, 2017 without chill filtration, the addition of water or color whatsoever. The resulting whisky is one of the most honest and quintessential expressions of the classic Speyside style available. A cornucopia of dried fruit, sweet cereal, orchard fruit and creamy texture makes this the perfect whisky for any occasion. Thanks to incredible work securing these stocks and unbelievable prices, we're able to offer the Munros line-up significantly below market value. While this is an exclusive in California for K&L, you might see the same bottle in other markets fetching upwards of $200. This whisky was aged in American oak hogsheads._The odd and delicious spirit coming off the stills at Tormore is not something we see very often stateside. It is one of the most beautiful new distilleries in Scotland, having been built in only 1960, the gorgeous tall white walls are contrasted by the stunning varnished green of its copper roofs. And like the odd dichotomy of the distillery itself, this whisky is another idiosyncratic and understated example of what is produced there. This whisky was aged for 22 years in American oak hogsheads. Let’s see how it tastes. The color is old gold. The nose is packed full of deep red fruit, with a curious orange peel component. Surrounding that is a roasted cereal quality that touches ever so slightly to the nutty aromas. Tiny hints of wood glue are actually weirdly inviting. On the palate, the lower than typical proof is not at all to its detriment in terms of texture, instead we have a round rich body and which add some wild honey and subtle floral flavors to the bouquet on the nose. The finish is medium long and satisfying with some almond extract and vanilla bean showing up. A fun, unique whisky that should not be overlooked because of its low proof or unusual provenance."
1482927,"Raasay ""While We Wait"" Isle of Raasay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","The Isle of Raasay has for centuries been associated with the production of illicit alcohol. The far flung Island on Scotland's west coast has only a couple hundred inhabitants, but they've now got their own distillery. While the spirit from those new stills won't be released in the US for another season or two, they've developed this limited edition batch to give us an idea of what the distillery can do. The source and age remain a mystery, but there's little dispute about the whisky chops behind this new distillery. It combines a peated and unpeated malt from one single distillery married in in Tuscan wine barrels. The complexity and nuance are undeniable. Tasting notes from the distillery, ""Nose: A welcome wave of smokiness, mixed with red berries, lemon and grassy notes. A second nosing brings pear, tangerine and melon. Palate:Dry peatiness mixed with red wine notes. A good dash of orange zest from the nose. Finish: Oaky and buttery finish.""_It seems as though the Raasay Distillery have found a lot of interesting things to do while their own stocks age and this, the first bottling under the Raasay name, is no exception. This is a lightly peated malt from the highlands of Scotland from an undisclosed source. There are only a few distilleries offering this style in the region and even fewer that are likely to be available to an up and coming distillery, but it's none the less difficult to parse out exactly where this might be sourced. Maybe from Ardmore, maybe Loch Lomond, maybe elsewhere. Many we see tend to be relatively full on. Whatever it is, it's subsequently finished in French oak which previously held Tuscan red wine. It is indeed an unusual combination, but I think it works pretty well and it certainly represents a unique flavor profile we're not often experiencing. The color is pale gold. The nose is a striking mix of smoldering chimney smoke  (not very peaty thought), red cherry and dried herbs. On the palate we get more of the peat, subtle salty dried fruit, dark smoked herbs and hints of ashy coal smoke. The French oak and the wine serve to gently coax the lightly smoked spirit, but don't over power with acrid or astringent flavors. It's a well rounded and appealing option for anyone looking for something ""lightly peated,"" a category that's surprisingly difficult to find in Scotland these days."

This old Cambus was rated 93 points by the renowned writer and reviewer. Here are his notes, Nose: Classic for the distillery, showing good corn oil and accompanying acacia honey sweetness; the oak offers a delicate Canadian touch. Taste: Stunning texture: a rare grain that appears both firm and yielding at the same moment. Also, exceptional crispness to the maple syrup sweetness. Big spices up front balance things beautifully. Finish: Begins to show a little age here with a vague bitterness apparent. But the tannins hold their own, as do the remedial sugars.Balance: An impressive example of what then was arguably the finest grain distillery in Scotland.

The small Oldmeldrum distillery sits right in the middle of town and quietly makes a small quantity of lovely spirits for those in the know. Long a part of the Morrison Bowmore stable of distilleries, it is today owned by Beam Suntory—famous for letting each of their Scottish properties continue to do what they do best. Back in the day they malted all of their own barley, but today the maltings are getting converted into more distillation capacity. What hasn’t changed however is the whisky's underlying character. The distillery still produces a beautiful weighty spirit that combines sweet fruit with heavy cereal notes. For a mere $55 bucks this cask strength non-chill filtered delivers the goods at a respectable 10 years old._NA"
1172353,Cut Spike Nebraska Single Malt Whiskey (750ml),"Here’s an unusual one: a single malt whiskey made in the Sandhills of Nebraska. While it’s barely two years old, it’s already showing a depth more common in much older spirits, with sweet woodsy scents, poached pear flavors and butterscotch notes rounded out with a toasty brown-butter-like richness. Distiller Mike Cunningham makes it with 100 percent malted barley that is fermented at Cut Spike’s sister company and brewery Lucky Bucket. I imagine this whiskey will get even better in the coming years, as the distillery develops older stocks, but even now it’s delicious.At first we couldn't believe our mouths. We knew that Cut Spike single malt had just taken Double Gold honors at the 2014 San Francisco Spirits competition , so obviously other people thought it was good, too. But after tasting so many mediocre American attempts at single-malt whiskey, we had become accustomed to the idea that the Scottish style of distillation would never be recreated here at home. There would be spin-offs, and experimental grasps at greatness, but that supple, malty profile would simply be something we needed to import from abroad. Then the folks at Cut Spike sent us a sample of their two-year-old Nebraskan single-malt whisky made from 100% malted barley on a pot still crafted in Rothes, Scotland. Fermented at the brewery next door to Cut Spike in La Vista, the malt was matured for two years in new American oak with varying levels of char. The result is an incredible hybrid: soft, barley and vanilla-laden whiskey that tastes somewhat like your standard Scottish single malt, but has its own unique character at the same time. It's the kind of whiskey you taste once and enjoy, but then the next day suddenly crave intensely. It impresses you instantly, yet doesn't really reveal its full character until weeks later. The new oak blurs seamlessly into the malty mouthfeel, adding a richness on the finish normally not tasted in standard Scottish selections. Cut Spike is a major accomplishment for American distillation, pure and simple._A complex nose with barrel spice and vanilla and an outdoorsy cedar woods aroma complimented by sweet stewed apples and pears. The palate is sweet at first with bright fruits, but this quickly gives way to caramel and vanilla with a backbone of pie spices on the lingering finish. All in all, an interesting and worthy bottle of American Single Malt Whiskey.

                I'm a whiskey guy! I love drinking it...smelling it... and collecting it! Easily, of course, my favorite of those three activities is the drinking, which makes this wonderful Nebraska whiskey so dangerous! It's so smooth that, if you're like me, you'll end up drinking way too much. Rich and savory in texture, this 2 year bottling is highlighted by an immense floral and herbaceous qualities. Along with a pronounced element of creamy vanilla, this is such a delight! 
            |
                Wow, this 3rd evolution of Cut Spike is a little different but even better.  Tropical fruits, ginger and a wonderful spicy wood on the nose move along to a beautiful mid palate of soft fruity lime and papaya, gentle Asian spice and lemon grass, then flow through to a smooth finish showing orange blossom, kaffir lime and notes of that wonderful vanilla the last offering had.  Very unique and impressive - and a must for any whisky lover.
            |
                We, along with enough customers (and critics) to quickly sell out the last couple batches, fell in love with the Cut Spike whiskey. The first time we tasted this American Single Malt we were floored. This current bottling is a bit brighter, with great clove, ginger and banana bread spice notes. Grab a bottle while you can! 'Merica!
            |
                Now this is a whiskey to get excited about. The sensation of flavor is an American hybrid marrying qualities of bourbon and Scotch. This sits in the glass with deep hues of burnt orange. The nose on this whiskey is totally delicious with fruity notes of tangerine, freshly cut fennel, and dried apple. The mid-palate is clean, soft and delivers characteristics reminiscent of cream soda, all culminating in a spiced, toasty rich finish. Get a bottle while they last!
            |
                Delicious and interesting. There are wonderful aromas that are a mixture of floral notes with some spice and citrus. In the mouth it is malty, juicy and smooth, with spicy undertones. The Cut Spike promises to be one fun drink.
            |
                With this being only their third release, the anticipation of what is in the bottle was very high: a chance to try and flesh out exactly what is the house style that the good distillers at Cut Spike bring to the table. This bottling does a great job of solidifying them in my mind as one of the highest quality single malt producers in the States.  This whisky is incredibly vibrant and fresh without tasting young or harsh. The nose is lifted with bright notes of candied ginger and Douglas fir, a sense of promised vanilla sweetness wafts in at the end. In the mouth there is sweetness, orange marmalade, a hint of clove for spice, and then the same vanilla cream from last batch that really adds roundness to the palate.  
            |
                Extremely unique and complex whisky with lots of gorgeous pine, rosemary and ginger notes melded together with the perfect amount of vanilla. It's great to be drunk by itself or mixed in cocktails. Also being that K&L is the only major retailer to carry this whisky, it is something rare to share with friends!
            |
                The new Cut Spike is incredibly intriguing! This batch displays a full range of baking spices on the nose with just a hint of cardamom. Nice weight and balance on the palate, with just the right amount of creamy, toasty characteristics to complement the exotic spice elements. A great buy!
            |
                When I first tasted the Cut Spike whiskey, I thought it was simply the best American single malt out there; a true revelation for the domestic category. However, as I'm now tasting the newest batch from the Nebraskan producer, I'm realizing that the whiskey is starting to morph into something very particular and unique to the brand. That classic creaminess is still very pervasive, but for the second time in a row there's a pronounced note of pine that soon mutates into ginger and Asian spices before quickly turning back into rich vanilla and oak on the finish; smoothly seeping its way into my taste buds as that last little sip goes down. What we're starting to witness here is the development of a house style--a flavor that defines this distillery. It's very exciting, and it's becoming infectious.
            |
                This is a delicious American Single Malt! Round, rich and great balance and length...don't miss this great craft whiskey that you'll only find here! Salute!
            |
                I have to say my palate wasn't quite sure where to place this flavor profile Scotch or Bourbon...Bourbon or Scotch...? But the one thing my taste buds certainly weren't confused about was how delicious it is! There is plenty of the detail and delicacy of single malt but everything is lacquered with the exotic wood spice and richness of American oak. The two flavor bases (the malt and the wood) have married together really well making this a fascinating drop that I really think will please both types of whisk(e)y drinkers.
            |
                Here is our latest entrant in American craft whiskey, a very tasty, skillfully made whiskey from Nebraska. Nebraska? Yes, Nebraska! As mentioned earlier, this is stylistically a Bourbon-meets Sherry-barrel-aged Single Malt. Lovely richness, lots of sweetness and spice from new American oak barrels, but most importantly, the balance, drinkability and elegance of a well made single malt Scotch. These folks clearly studied how things are done in Scotland, and it shows. Very cool new whiskey that is well worth a try!
            |
                This rich, layered whisky shows just how good young craft malt can be. I am not a believer in paying a high price for young stuff just because it comes from a small hands-on distillery. It has to be in the bottle, and the Cut Spike has the stuffing to justify the price. It is rich and textural without being over the top, and has layers of complexity that caught me by surprise. If you are interested in seeing how good a new distiller can be, check it out!"
1235553,"Arran ""The Bothy"" Quarter Cask Cask Strength Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) (Elsewhere $100)","Independently owned since its inception in 1995, the folks at Arran have been quietly making some of the very best island distilled whisky in Scotland for 25 years. Their water source is 100% rainwater coming from Loch Na Davie high above the distillery. The clean water combined with 100% concerto malt and a careful distillation is the essence of Arran - it's fresh, barley forward and shows flavors heavy with citrus, stone fruit, and vanilla pudding. They never color or chill filter any of their whiskies choosing instead to retain all of the natural beauty they worked so hard to capture. The first fill bourbon casks of The Bothy are further enhanced by a 2 year finishing in quarter cask made of American oak. The smaller casks would have been typical of the whiskies being transported to and from the island in the 18th and 19th centuries as they are much easier to move around. Today, Arran has brought this tradition back to the island._The Arran is an excellent distillery and each release seems to get better and better. This 3rd batch of the Bothy is the best we've had and so we snagged a bit of the old stock before the new importer took over. Here we've got the use of new American oak quarter casks, which if not done with restraint could be a problem in my view. Luckily Arran is extremely careful and knows that each batch must be just right in order to keep building their reputation. The color is deep gold. The nose is full of fresh oak, but in a lively and not obtrusive way. It's got some citrus peel, tangerines and Seville, plus plenty of vanilla and a bit of coconut. On the palate the wood takes a back seat, thankfully, and let the malt come through offering up some nice caramel candy, toasted cereal and hints of mocha. With water we really start to open up bringing some fresh spices and sweet herbs on the nose. These play nicely with the continued orange peel notes and a bit more sweetness now. On the palate it's more viscous now and loses some of the roasted quality in favor of more fruit and spice. A totally delicious example of how to properly use new oak in single malt production.
            |
                The glorious combination of pure, clean, unadulterated concerto malt and first fill bourbon is unmistakable. The malt is so crystal clear that it's like walking through a barley field after a fresh rain. It's bright, sweet and cereal driven. Fresh baked bread intermingles with the sweeter pastries at the shop - marzipan, apple turnover, baklava and custard tarts. A finish in quarter casks brings out a touch more woody notes. Fresh cedar saw dust, vanilla, a gentle pull of tannin on the finish livens the whole drinking experience up. It's a light and bright malt at cask strength - a wonderfully mellow 53.2%. If you do choose to add water you'll unlock more stone fruit notes and a rounder and very supple mouth feel. One of Scotland's hidden gems, the independent Arran distillery has quietly produced some of the very best malts since its opening in 1995. The Bothy is a must buy for anyone who loves a malt forward whisky."
1235554,"Arran ""Machrie Moor"" Cask Strength Peated Island Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","The folks at Arran, which has been independently owned since its inception in 1995, have been quietly making some of the very best island-distilled whisky in Scotland for 25 years. Their water source is 100% rainwater coming from Loch Na Davie, high above the distillery. The clean water, combined with 100% concerto malt and a careful distillation, is the essence of Arran — it's fresh, barley-forward, and shows flavors heavy with citrus, stone fruit, and vanilla pudding. They never color or chill filter any of their whiskies, choosing instead to retain all of the natural beauty they worked so hard to capture. The Machrie Moor, named for a distinct peat bog on the west coast of the island, features a fresh blast of peat that perfectly matches the amazing freshness of the Lochranza distillate. Since 2019 all of the peated production on the Isle of Arran has moved to the new Lagg distillery on the south side of the island. This is the last chance to sock away a few bottles of the cask strength Lochranza peated whisky before it’s gone forever._This fun whisky from Arran is now more or less extinct, at least in this package. We are forever in search of a great malt that can properly described as ""somewhat peaty."" Despite what many might believe, there are very few in-between malts. Almost everything that's readily available is either 30+ parts or zero. Yes, there are a few exceptions: Oban, Balvenie, Dalwhinnie...But, in general, these don't really cross the threshold to really feel the peat in a big way (Oban is probably the closest). There's of course a few exceptions, but the options are extremely limited. So when we came across the Machrie Moor at a very reasonable 20 ppm, we were intrigued. Now add that this small batch is not colored, and bottled at cask strength, and that's a recipe for something special. The color is pale gold. The nose is extremely focused, with an obvious ocean quality, but not the Laphroiag slap that some peat lovers might be craving. Instead, the smoke is lingering in the background with salinity and crystalline malt coming through. Clean and gentle, yet not boring by any means. On the palate some smoldering peat and some green earthiness. Green apple skin, crushed oyster shell, and bits of citrus. This is NOT a lightly peated whisky, but it's a balanced medium peater, which is really very rare in our world. Bottled at cask strength, it's delicious, but this guy loves water too, so don't be afraid to hit it with a few satisfying splashes of water. It develops some interesting character at the slightly lower proofs, offering more citrus, more fruit, and a bit of the salted fish character that we all love so well. 
            |
                The color of dried straw and with a nose of smoldering peat, the cask strength Machrie Moor gives us a brief glimpse into what we might expect from the Lagg distillery in a number of years, albeit on a different set of stills. Rather than being very heavily peated, the Machrie Moor clocks in at 20PPM peat levels, just enough to shine against the light and  fruity background of Arran without overwhelming it. It's really a perfect summertime peater. Fresh and salty with tons of sweet citrus. Dusted in cocoa powder and redolent with caramelized almonds. The peat hangs like the air after a campfire is put out — warm and heavy."

While we inherently believe that the innocuous act of adding the tiniest possible quantity of another malt to a single barrel of Scotch does nothing to diminish the quality of a particular whisky, there is an intellectual argument to be made for keeping the sanctity and purity of a single cask intact. In the end, we've made the decision that in almost every case the more important factor for our customers is value over image. So while we had wanted desperately to be able to name this excellent distillery and could have likely sold every bottle for much more than the 25% premium that avoiding a tariffs would have afforded us, we believe that it is in the best interest of our customers to offer them the very best whiskies at the best possible prices regardless perception. That is indeed what this special cask represents. Even years ago, when whisky was plentiful and comparatively cheap, we would have been lucky to find a deal as sweet as this one. At this advanced aged, this famous old Speyside exhibits all the finesse and elegance you'd expect. A nose of creamy malt, Seville orange peel and honey candies. Sweet rich malt and stewed fruit on the palate with kisses of toasted vanilla, caramel tuiles and touches of warming wood spice on the finish. While some would've paid an extra $50 to show off the famous Linkwood name, we prefer mystery and affordability. We think most of our customers do too._NA"

1467372,"Kaiyo ""K&L Exclusive"" Cask #541 Cask Strength Japanese Whisky (750ml)","Like so many Japanese whiskies that have come to the market in recent years, Kaiyo remains an enigma. It tastes delicious, there is a tantalizing background story to the brand, but the level of detail a whisky geek desires always seem in short supply. No matter, ultimately when the price is right and the whisky tastes great, we are here to pull the trigger. The two casks are similar in their story, but very different in the final profile. Both are Japanese in origin, presumably teaspooned malt from the same source. They were placed into Mizunara oak for nearly 7.5 years and then each made Kaiyo's hallmark Ocean voyage. The gentle rocking, salt air, temperature and humidity changes are all a part of the whisky's story. Once they disembarked from their ship their stories diverge. Cask #541 sees a year long finishing in a refill hogshead barrel. This adds a bit of complexity to the profile yet preserves the Mizunara oak as the defining characteristic. It's a masterclass in Mizunara. Over time in glass you can pick out a wide array of sweet tropical notes ranging from juicy fruits to toasty coconut and a cabinet full of exotic spices. At 56% ABV and unchillfiltered, there is power, weight, and texture to bolster what is otherwise an elegant and complex dram._The first selection ever of a Kaiyo single cask. After 7.4 years in Mizunara oak, this beauty was transferred to a 2nd fill hogshead for a little mellowing. It’s chockablock full of vanilla, coconut, honey and sandalwood. The stylistic preference in Japan for whiskies that are balanced and nuanced is clearly present, but this is not a shy malt. The barley shines from the get go, but add a little water and it explodes. At 56% ABV it’s a robust and full throttle whiskey that screams of its time in Mizunara with its bold and spicy wood profile.
            |
                The enigmatic and opaque Kaiyo whisky has become a staple on our shelves. It does a lot of things right in the very complicated Japanese Whisky genre while maybe skirting some of the most obvious pitfalls. And I still have no information about what is actually in these bottles, but we can assume that these have been aged in Japanese Mizunara and are likely sourced from malt distilled in Northern Japan (Hokkaido & Sendai). And while these distilleries are some of the world's finest, it is clearly the barrel who is the star of the show here. Interestingly, the two barrels we purchased (541 & 543) are pretty different despite having the same proof and specs on the bottle. This cask is the most quintessential expression of the flavors I'd expect from Mizunara. The nose is tight at first and needs a drop or two of water to open up. Now we get tons of sandalwood, ceremonial incense, plum wine, coconut husk. On the palate, tons of red cherry and big spice - cinnamon, clove, nutmeg etc. It's long bold and peppery. This one is really pretty intense designed for those who like more intense flavors. Adding water doesn't necessarily diminish that but adds some depth and sweetness."

Cereal-led palate with Golden Grahams, light fruits of apricot, peach, and melon, base notes of pepper, moving through butterscotch, toffee, maple syrup, and crème caramel.This unusual whisky takes advantage of Japan's relatively lax regulations for bottling ""Japanese Whisky."" In Japan, any whisky aged in Japan can be bottled as Japanese Whisky. Chichibu's owner and master distiller Ichiro Akuto travels the world acquiring barrels from every whisky producing nation.

1394434,"Hombo Shuzo Mars Shinshu Komagatake ""Limited Edition 2019"" Single Malt Japanese Whisky (750ml)","If whisky were a warm hug, this would be it. The sweet nose is rich with a lovely fruitiness of satsuma, Seville orange marmalade, yuzu, and vanilla. This carries a velvety texture rippled with an orange-flavored effervescence; apricot jam, sweet orange, sherbet, fine spices, ground ginger, and hot pepper. If this well-made example is an indication of the Mars Shinshu house style, they are getting a lot of things right.The history of the excellent Mars Distillery is long and complicated. The special stills that now sit at the high altitude distillery near Nagano were hand built to the specifications of the preeminent grandfather of Japanese Whisky, Masataka Taketsuru. In the 1950s, Taketsuru-san's mentor Iwai Kiichiro, who had commissioned his famed voyage to Scotland, designed and built two pot stills for Hombo Shuzo in Yamanashi using Takesturu's original specifications. The stills were moved to Kagoshima not long after production started and eventually moved again to Nagano in the early 80s. For another decade, Mars Whisky operated their old pot stills from their mountain home, but lackluster demand for whisky caused Hombo to cease operations completely at the plant in 1992. But renewed interest in the late '00s for Japanese whisky compelled the owners to relaunch the brand and recommission the old pots at Mars Shinshi in Nagano. Now Mars Whisky consists of two distilleries, this one and another at the Mars headquarters on Kumamoto called Tsunuki. Production is tiny compared to their next largest competitors, Suntory and Nikka, but Mars' single malts have become renowned for their extremely high quality. The Limited Editions are bottled at 48% and aged in primarily ex-bourbon barrels with various other cask types blended in without detail. An excellent example of what the future of craft Japanese whisky looks like and one of the more collectable and unique offerings on the market today._The excellent Mars Distillery in Nagano has played third fiddle to the big boys during the Japanese Whisky explosion, but their special releases are still snatch up by collectors as quickly as we can get them. Last year, we were allocated we received a minuscule 36 bottle allocation. It was sold out in a day. This year we were able to muscle the supplier for more than 20 cases thanks to the fact that bars all over the country are closed. So, for the first time in ages, we're able to market a collectible Limited Edition Japanese Single Malt that isn't made from Canadian or Irish Whiskey bulked into Japan, marked up and bottled as Japanese. This is real Japanese malt here and Mars is making some seriously delicious stuff. The stills were hand built in the 50s and moved around the country during various periods, but production began in earnest again at the Nagano plant in 2009, so this is not very old whisky by any means. The malt is dried with the tiniest amount of peat smoke, around 3-5 parts per million. Their Limited Edition apparently comes from the warmest parts of the warehouse. The top floors is what one source mentions. Hombo Shuzo seems to have some Kentucky style racking warehouses, which are not unheard of in Scotland either. This vast majority of this batch was aged in first fill ex-bourbon, with tiny amounts of virgin oak and sherry butts thrown in for good measure. Let's have a taste. Almost an hour of aeration the glass before tasting. The color is old gold. A gorgeous nose of fresh orchard fruit: yuzu, poire d'anjou, mirabelle, Crispins and more. A pristine, almost chiseled character on the nose, focused, refined, but not monotonous. Fleeting slivers of spice and vanilla, but the pure fruity malt is front and center. It might be young malt, but it's very very good malt. On the palate, we're starting to see more American oak take charge, still with some fruit there though. A bit of roasted vanilla bean, cinnamon spice, twinges of espresso and burnt sugar. The fruit is maybe a bit more tropical now. The tiniest drop of water washes away the slightly overt wood on the palate bringing some lively citrus and unusual herbal character. Is it tarragon? A decidedly refreshing take on the white-hot Japanese malt category. It isn't simply an approximation of Scottish single malt, but a window into what will certainly become the house style in years to come, and an idiosyncratic style that I believe allows it to stand alone among it's peers. While the collectors may snatch this up, it's the drinkers who will undoubtedly get the most out of it.

                I will never forget the first time I tasted a Komagatake. Like most people, up until that point my exposure to Japanese whisky centered around Suntory and Nikka, and I had only recently seen Mars' Iwai label hit shelves. That first bottle changed my perception of Japanese whisky forever, and I am so happy to reacquaint myself with this line. Looking at the label, you can immediately see this is something special, and the liquid inside truly lives up to the expectation. A striking nose of lemon oil, cut hay, peach blossom and pine sets the tone. The palate presents a refined and fully realized amalgam of gorgeous flavor- grilled peach, marzipan, creamy vanilla, nutty toffee, mountain herbs and barrel spice, all beautifully intermingling with a whisper of smoke and black tea. The craft is evident in how these components come together, perfectly integrated, to create something almost deceptively simple, yet intricate and delicate and complex. These bottles are always a special treat, and I implore you to plumb its depths, savor its full array of flavors, and experience the tranquility that can only come from this divine facility tucked into the mountains."

Aromas of honey, cherry gummy bears, red apple, heady floral scents, banana muffin, vanilla essence, menthol, and feisty aromatic spices. The palate takes a journey through honey, grapefruit, lime zest, Honey Smacks cereal, red apple, playful spices, then more sherry fruit matched by ginger, clove, and pepper.Sandwiched between Japan’s soaring Southern Alps and the towering Central Alps, at just over 2,600 feet, Mars Shinshu is Japan’s highest whisky distillery. The Hombo family have been distilling for more than a century and they added whisky to their repertoire in 1949. Back then the distillery was located in Kagoshima Prefecture on the southern most island of Kyushu. Until 1984, it was the southernmost whisky made in Japan, which ended with the Hombo clan moving the distillery to the idyllic alpine setting of Miyada village in southern Nagano Prefecture. They chose this site for its cool temps, which slowed maturation, and the plentiful, soft, granite-filtered snowmelt-fed aquifers._NA"
1251897,"Kilchoman ""Sanaig"" Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","A new, and welcome, permanent member of the core Kilchoman range, this comes from a mix of sherry finished and sherry matured whisky. The nose kicks off with a lovely cigar ash note—a cigar club toward the end of the evening—and while there are some dried fruits from the sherry, Kilchoman’s gentle, light character gives energy and lemony lift—shellfish, grass, and herbs. Lovely balance. Rounded, softly fruity, and highly approachable.The newest full-time release from Kilchoman distillery, located on Scotland's island of Islay, is called ""Sanaig"" and takes the standard bourbon aged portion of the Machir Bay and finishes the whole thing in sherry. The traditional bourbon cask maturation is complemented with aging in Oloroso sherry butts, adding both richness and texture to the whisky. The result is a chewier, denser, sweeter, and more decadent experience, but one still full of all the flavors that make Kilchoman what it is: smoke, peat, salt and earth._I am so glad I finally got to try a couple different expressions from the newest distillery on Islay, and I am so impressed with this whisky. A lovely whiff of smoke on the nose lets you know you are getting into an Islay; however, the sherry casking lends it a smooth and rich body without being brooding. Slightly nutty and fruity notes play against the smoke and lead to a long finish with low heat. This whisky does not need an age statement at all, it stands up and delivers incredibly well for a newer, younger blend."

The three friends have bottled hundreds of casks for their whiskey groups. Steve and Reid started selecting casks in 2008, bottling a number of now famous casks of Willetts. Reid and Steve went on to found 1789b, a private group of booze lovers focused on selecting single cask American Whiskey. Likewise, Paul was the first to identify the incredible brandies being bottled by L'Encantada from Lous Pibous and bottled the first casks for the US for the ""Brandy Brothers"" via K&L Wine Merchants.

Their incredible reputation has allowed them access to this brand's entire selection of old high quality grain whisky. This category is still in its infancy and this secret source rolled out 53 of their best casks. The team chose the three they felt would appeal most to their compatriots in 1789b and dark spirits lovers at large. This single cask of Invergordon was filled into first fill Jack Daniels barrels on May 21st, 1990. This barrel is not as sweet and corn driven on the nose as the other Invergordon from B2B, but instead offers complex herbal notes coupled with a nuanced fruit character. Big clove, corn oil and spice are the hallmarks here on the palate. Another great barrel from the upstart bottler._The two tiny casks of Invergordon brought in by Barrel to Bottle are definitely intended to attract the bourbon drinker to this exciting category. I try to avoid selling Single Grain as ""bourbon light"" partly because I think that over simplifies the category and more precisely because I believe often misleads the consumer about what they're getting. But the B to B guys have found two casks that work wonders to cross over really the categories, while staying true to the Single Grain aesthetic. I think these are really fun to taste together so I'll add my notes for both here. The color for both of these is yellow gold. The nose on barrel 981 is more classic grain with notes of marzipan, yellow flowers, coconut, hay bails, vanilla. By contrast barrel 090 has more corn oil, more oak, maple syrup, cooked cereals and baked apples. On the palate, both far surpass the relatively restrained nose. #90 is very sweet up front, textured, oily, baked sweet corn, subtle herbs and a long citrus-y finish. Barrel #981 has more vanilla, a bit of melon and more spice. There's still some sweetness, but building toward a large spicy finish. Adding 3ml of water softens #981 slightly and I think I like the bold intensity of it at cask strength better, but #90 loves the water. Adding the same amount brings a bit more stone fruit and heightens the experience on the palate significantly. The are surprisingly unique within this context and while they still offer a much more restrained and elegant experience than any old bourbon, they will certainly scratch an itch that most bourbon drinkers might not even know they have."

1326848,Kaiyo Mizunara Oak Cask Strength Japanese Whisky (750ml),"Fully matured in mizunara oak on land and sea, this has tangy orange, ground ginger, fennel seed, cedar, and incense, though it seems a little more tightly wound than the standard strength whisky. Juicy orange, quick firecracker spices, and more toffee sweetness; it becomes heavy and thick, flaunting high alcohol, then turns creamier with marzipan, orange Jell-O, and singed oak spices. Jonny McCormickKaiyo is a bottler started by a drinks group led by former Asahi employee Mr. Watanabe who was able to purchase ""teaspooned"" malt whisky barrels from an unnamed Japanese whisky supplier via his connections in the industry . For those unfamiliar with the legend of Japanese Mizunara oak, it's become heralded in the whisky world both for the exotic flavors of incense, sandalwood, and coconut it passes along to the spirit, as well as its expense. Difficult to cooper and notoriously inefficient as a vessel, editions of Yamazaki and Bowmore aged in Mizunara wood have sold at four figure prices, making the Kaiyo whiskies in comparison seem like a steal. The cask strength version of Kaiyo Mizunara is basically a stronger, more intense version of the regular edition with everything turned up. The orange peel notes and oak spices on the nose jump out of the glass, the sandalwood and vanilla are bold on the palate, and there's a lot more concentration of oak on the finish. It's a more expressive and intense version of the desired Mizunara influence._The cask strength Kaiyo is similar to the Kaiyo that is bottle at 43% abv. but it  is fuller bodied and the flavors are more pronounced. With a splash of water it gets an almost creamy aspect. It is complex and offers  interesting spice, pepper and wood notes that set this whiskey apart and help make it an unique experience.  
            |
                If you're a fan of gentle, smooth, and restrained malt whiskies, then I think the standard Kaiyo is the way to go. However, if you like bold flavors, assertive spice, and lots of potency, then it's definitely worth the extra thirty bucks to bump up to the cask strength version because the Mizunara-influenced flavors explode on the palate with the extra proof. You get bursts of candied orange, coconut, and sweet malt, highlighted by sweet oak notes on the finish with lots of power. This is for the real whisky geeks. 
            |
                As you might expect this is a bigger, bolder, more concentrated expression of the non cask strength bottling. It shares the same exotic spice notes, floral tones, sweet grains but has much more viscosity, weight and intensity on the palate. It's chewier...quite robust for a Japanese whisky...this is going to make a lot of people happy at (all things considered) a pretty inexpensive price point."

Non chill-filtered, 54.2% abv._Recommended for those with a love for--or a tolerance that may blossom at some time in the indeterminate future--peaty, sherry-influenced single malt. After I had tasted a sample of the Ardbeg Uigeadail and sort of gave it thumbs down in my personal notes, later I purchased a whole bottle and followed it over a while. Why? There's just something about it. There's dried seaweed, some plaster from a seaside cottage renovation, perhaps, some dried fish on a grill fired by beach brush. And mid to high-toned sherry underneath. But there's more, and whatever that more is, it keeps me coming back from time to time.
            |
                I love Ardbeg, and the Uigeadail is one of the most special expressions that I have had from this great Islay distillery. No other distillery makes a malt quite as peaty as Ardbeg, and this one has an additional twist: sherry wood aging. The sherry wood gives another dimension of richness and weight to this typically light and piercing single malt. I have a bottle at home, and I love it for a cold night by the fire - but Alex Brisoux (the Redwood City store manager) swears by it with oysters! That is a combination that is hard for me to imagine, but I don't doubt a professional like Alex on a topic as serious as pairings!"

                Filled in 3 different barrel types, this dram showcases American Bourbon casks, Spanish Olorosso butts, and unctuous Pedro Ximenez casks. This cask regimen does several things. The bourbon highlights the inherent fruity, vanilla cake, and creme brulee character of the spirit. The Olorosso adds gobs of cocoa, nuttiness, and toffee. And of course, the PX dials up a beautiful sweetness, intensity, and raisined fruits. While this triple casks regime adds layers of complexity, body, and richness, it also belies the notion that Lowland whisky is light and simple. At just $56.99 this is a shameless sherry dram for every day enjoyment. While the lowlands does have some highly coveted bottles, it's this kind of easy enjoy-ability that makes it such a special place for whisky.

                The Three Wood beautifully showcases the movement away from age statements and toward creative cask finishes. On the nose, it immediately offers enticing aromas of dried fruit, orange peel, caramelized sugar and ample spice. On the palate, it tastes full and complex despite its three distillations. Vanilla and dry sherry dominate at first but give way to soft tones of toffee and raisins. Typical of lowland malts, the finish brings a lingering nutty sweetness, but with a hint of charred wood. Altogether, it makes for an endlessly enjoyable dram that satisfies most any palate. I highly recommend this bottle for fans of bourbon or Irish whisky trying to break into Scottish single malts. It's also a great pick for scotch drinkers looking for something new in a sherry-focused style.

The aging of this whisky in Bourbon barrels along with Oloroso and Pedro Ximenez Sherry casks gives the spirit deep richness. On the nose I get luscious ripples of dark chocolate, salted nuts, leather, and dried dark berries. The whisky provides flavors of salted caramel with cacao nibs, black cherry, light tobacco, leather, and woody sweet finish. Treat yourself to this Scotch after dinner like dessert in a glass."

It has had a rocky history ever since with many repeated closures, sometimes decades long. But in 1993, Burn Stewart Distillers saved the day and the distillery. They rechristened it Tobermory and established today’s practice of distilling unpeated malt for half of the year and heavily peated malt for the other half. In its modern incarnation, the Tobermory name applies to the smoke free spirit and the Ledaig name for the peated variety. Here we have a gorgeous expression of the Ledaig at 21 years old aged in a hogshead that allowed all that peat to mature without being overpowered by the wood. While we had hoped to teaspoon all of the years blended malt casks with a nearby distillery, there aren’t any. Using Tobermory spirit wouldn’t technically declassify Ledaig because it’s the same distillery and therefore still a single malt. We had to look to the other Hebridiean Isles for mature spirit that could sustain this 21 year old age statement.

No matter, ultimately when the price is right and the whisky tastes great, we are here to pull the trigger. The two casks are similar in their story, but very different in the final profile. Both are Japanese in origin, presumably teaspooned malt from the same source. They were placed into Mizunara oak for nearly 7.5 years and then each made Kaiyo's hallmark Ocean voyage. The gentle rocking, salt air, temperature and humidity changes are all a part of the whisky's story. Once they disembarked from their ship their stories diverge. Cask #543 has a much more unique finishing than #541. After its ocean stint the whisky was transferred to a ruby port pipe for a year. The dark red fruited wine cask has lent a wide array of flavors to frame the initial Mizunara aging. Dark chocolate, dried dates, ripe currants, and sweet raisins all meld with the sandalwood and coconut of the oak. Unchillfiltered and bottled at %56 ABV._Like its sister cask, this comes from some of Kaiyo’s oldest stocks – after nearly seven and half years in Japanese Mizunara oak the whisky was transferred into a ruby port pipe for another year of finishing. The result is a spectacular array of red fruits and raisins to frame the spicy yet tropical flavors of Mizunara oak. The hallmark sandalwood notes are particularly persistent on the finish. It’s amazing how much power the famed Japanese wood carries into the spirit, to see it with a unique finish that compliments it so well is a real treat. With a dash of water a much more complex array of red currants, dusty cocoa, and candied nuts come forward on the nose and palate. It's as though that water is the key that unlocks the port pipes Mizunara cage.

                These wild casks of Japanese Mizunara Oak aged whisky have been are a bit of a mystery, but tasting them side by side is a really interesting experience. While cask 541 had tons of spice and this one has much more fruit. The nose starts with classic Mizunara plums spice, but melds into a complex bouquet of wild honey, baked apple, earthy malt and fresh oak. The softer nose doesn't translate to the palate and we've still got that bold oak and spice from the Mizunara taking over. Yet here more subtlety, more malt and a bit more sweetness. There's something that reminds me distinctively of Ben Nevis, which would be appropriate considering the assumed source. A very interesting offering indeed."

This bottling marks their first release for the U.S. and is limited to just 1,680 bottles. Operating as a true farm distillery, all of the barley used for production is farmed by Francis Cuthbert on the estate and the distillery operates just 4 months out of the year for 2 months after each harvest. This traditional way of running a distillery hasn't been seen in Scotland since the 1800's.  It also makes Daftmill one of the smallest distilleries in Scotland, producing just about 100 casks a year. This release is a melding of 7 different casks, all 12 years old._I feel very lucky to have visited the good Mr. Cuthbert at his farm and distillery in the Summer of 2016. The beautiful and tiny distillery is hidden behind barley fields and built inside a gorgeous old stone farmhouse. Francis was in the distillery taking measurements, a truly hands on distillery owner. He seemingly does everything, although one must assume there are others helping, there's no question that this tiny production distillery is a labor of love. We tasted several casks together all around 10 years old and while I thought they all tasted pretty good, he brushed off the idea of bottling them saying unequivocally that they weren't ready. This man knows barley and we've waited with bated breath to see these barrels meet his high standards for bottling. Now after waiting almost 4 more years, we finally have access to this excellent and unusual single malt from one of Scotland's smallest and most watched distillers. The color is white wine. The nose starts restrained, but obvious complexity hides right behind the initial austerity of first nosing. As it opens, we start to notice vibrant stone fruits: apricots, plums, peaches. Then a mineral element and some citrus, lemon oil components. It's got a very old school feeling that isn't really available from any other modern distiller. A drop of water and a bit more time and we're being delivered truckloads of various fruits tropical and continental, some poached and drizzled in vanilla sauce. Creamy and luscious on the palate with wisps of white pepper and perfect clean American oak. This stuff is just lovely in every sense of the word. It's a new old-style malt unlike so many of the modern new distillers who are trapped between the science and art of single malt distillation.

                This is as close to the roots of whisky as you can get. A true farm distillery making it the way it would have been done 200+ years ago. You get two crops of barley a year - shortly after harvest, you make whisky, then you tend to the other issues on the farm for the rest of the year. The estate nature of this whisky is quite romantic, but more importantly, the whisky taste spectacular. At 12 years of age it is decidedly mature, but in the way of a precocious child - it drinks beyond the years of a young distillery, yet shows how much more there is still to come as it continues to grow. Wildly exciting and filled with promise. The whisky is a blend of 7 first fill bourbon barrels filled at the end of their first summer season (September, 2006). It's delicate and light, but with an intensity of flavor that is unmatched. There is a complex nose of florals, sweet cream, candied ginger, vanilla, and fine brown sugar and zest. The palate is spicy and difficult to pin down. It feels alive on the tongue jumping between citrus, ginger, pound cake, and caramel candies. The finish shows fresh cut summer grasses and lots of stone fruit. With only 1680 bottles produced in this summer release it's sure to be a collector's classic for those that can keep their hands off of it. For those that drink it - a splendid example of what whisky must have been."
1323099,"Ardbeg ""An Oa"" Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","Ardbeg doles out occasional limited releases for their avid fans, but for nearly a decade the core range consisted of just three whiskies: 10 year old, Uigeadail, and Corryvreckan. The addition of An Oa, matured in a combination of virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez sherry, and bourbon barrels, and married in a French oak ‘gathering vat’ prior to bottling, marks a reason to celebrate. An Oa is a more approachable Ardbeg. It lacks some of the typical oiliness, but flavor and complexity abound with hot peat, black tea, and peppery cloves. Die-hard Ardbeg fans should have no complaints, and new converts have a real treat in store.For the first time in a long time, we’ve got a permanent new member of the Ardbeg portfolio to tell you about. This isn’t some new committee release or another $100+ bottle of limited edition, space-themed, gimmick-oriented Islay malt. This is the new “An Oa,” a reasonably-priced and absolutely delicious new addition to the trio of 10 year, Uigeadail, and Corryvreckan that not only brings value back into the LVMH peated empire, but also serious flavor and enjoyment. Believe it or not, it’s not always easy to enjoy a bottle of whisky when it costs you three figures, you can only buy a limit of one bottle, and you’re scared to drink each sip for fear you’ll never be able to replace the experience. With the An Oa, Ardbeg is bringing not only functionality back to their core range, they’re bringing fun and flavor, to boot. The distillery's notes: ""A welcome new addition to the Ultimate range. Ardbeg An Oa is singularly rounded, due in no small part to time spent in our newly established bespoke oak Gathering Vat where whiskies from several cask types - including; sweet Pedro Ximenez; spicy virgin charred oak; and intense ex-bourbon casks, amongst others - familiarise themselves with each other. The result is a dram with smoky power, mellowed by a delectable, smooth sweetness. Hallmark Ardbeg peat, dark chocolate and aniseed are wrapped in smooth, silky butterscotch, black pepper and clove, before rising to an intense crescendo of flavour.""_The An Oa is the best new Ardbeg I’ve tasted in more than five years and it’s the roundest and easiest to drink of the regularly available editions. While it doesn’t pack the power that both the Uigeadail and Corryvreckan offer with their bold proofs, it makes up for it with richness and a rounded sweetness on the finish. You get all the peat, brine, smoke, and salt that you could ever want, but with more texture and perhaps finesse—not something we normally associate with the beastly Islay profile. In any case, this is the first bottle of Ardbeg in some time that I’ve been adamant about buying for my own personal daily enjoyment, not just my collection. 
            |
                I'm so thrilled this has arrived! I was fortunate enough to taste a sample 3 weeks ago and I've been hounding David about the release date ever since! Better yet, this isn't a flash in the pan. This is part of the new core lineup at Ardbeg and boy does it live up to my high expectations for Ardbeg flagship products. Beautifully married, this blend sings with sea salt brine, extinguished bonfire, malty goodness, and toasted brush. It's even better on the palate. The sweetness of the PX casks really livens up the mix. Cocoa notes and a bourbon spice profile play beautifully with a candied granola that is blanketed in the smooth smoky profile of Ardbeg you already love. Did I mention this is here to stay? I only have to buy one today, because after I finish it I can buy another next week. And the week after. Glorious.
            |
                This incredibly elegant and sophisticated Ardbeg retains the peaty personality of the distillery while showcasing a suaver side of Islay. I enjoyed my little taste of this immensly, and I can't wait to take it home and drink it my favorite way- after dinner. Any fan of Islay malts should have a bottle of this generous, textural Ardbeg!"
1449221,"Macallan ""Edition No. 5"" Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","Intended to showcase the color of Macallan, the fifth annual Edition release has been aged in a variety of American oak casks. The nose is initially reticent and offers dried fruits, salted caramel, sawdust, and ginger. Extremely smooth on the palate, with more dried fruits, ripe plums, milk chocolate, new leather, and black pepper. The finish is medium in length, with leather and dark chocolate.As reported in The Spirits Business: ""The Macallan Edition No.5 is described as a 'homage to the diversity and complexity of natural colour.' The whisky has been aged exclusively in American oak casks, offering 'sweet notes of caramel and fresh fruit combined with oak spices.' It follows the launch of four previous expressions in the Edition range, which 'explores the unique elements' of The Macallan. … Pantone Color Institute created an exclusive colour for The Macallan Edition No.5 – an 'intricate combination' of red and blue.""_NA"
1057007,Glenmorangie 18 Year Old Single Malt Whisky (750ml),"Despite the rich, buttery scent this single malt sips relatively dry. Rounded pear and sherry notes lead the palate at first, drying to leather and cigar wrapper and finishing long, with lemon zest and ginger zing. Water brings out more fruit, a tinge of violet, sprinkles of brown sugar and cinnamon sweetness, and a smoky whiff on the finish. Amazing complexity.This is part of the distiller’s Extremely Rare range, and has been matured in bourbon casks for 15 years, before a third is transferred to oloroso sherry casks for 3 years. Dried fruits, icing sugar, honey, lemon cheesecake, and floral aromas on the nutty nose. The palate offers figs, crème brûlée, cinnamon, more honey, and citrus fruit. The finish sees citrus fruit and oak merge nicely.If I had to pick my favorite whisky from the LVMH line up, including all the Ardbeg expressions, I'd easily choose the 18 year old from Glenmorangie. It's the best whisky they make for the price and everybody likes it: beginners, casual sippers, experts, whisky geeks. It's so gentle, supple, rich, and full of flavor. The problem for me at K&L was getting a competitive price. Soft stone fruit, caramel, crême brulée, vanilla, all the way to the finish._If you are a fan of single malt, this whisky should not be overlooked. We tasted this blind at our staff spirits tasting and it impressed me with its sweet and savory nuttiness, rich oily texture and long, polished finish. This is top notch unpeated whisky that will please the connoisseur without alienating the initiated.
            |
                Great price for a great whiskey!  Glenmorangie cuts their heads and tails (look it up) more than probably any other distillery in the world- leaving and very pure and light distillate behind.  This intense and long barrel age has left that pure spirit a rich and malty backbone with incredible vibrancy.  A scotch this good at a price this good does not last long!
            |
                This is a perfect gift because it is elegant and tastey and is bound to please most single malt lovers. The Glenmorangie 18 is malty with subtle hints of spice. It has layers of flavor yet is very easy to drink."
1433379,"Glenmorangie ""Quinta Ruban"" 14 Year Old Extra Matured Range Port Cask Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","This Quinta Ruban succeeds the 12 year old version, adding two additional years of finishing in port casks, while maintaining the same bargain price. The result is a symphony of understated opulence. Marzipan, fresh apple and pear, milk chocolate, red berries, candied ginger, and praline on the nose build slowly, leading into a fruity, spiced palate. Flavors of soft gingerbread, molasses cake, cherry pie, spiced plums, almond nougat, and dark chocolate intermingle with faint strains of pipe tobacco. It sings on the finish, with a parting crescendo of hazelnut, spice, cigar wrapper, and lengthy oak.Glenmorangie has updated their core range and bumped the age statement on the classic Quinta Ruban Port finished Scotch to 14 years instead of 12. The Quinta Ruban is an intense, incredibly dark whisky in the extra matured range from Glenmorangie. It first spends 10 years in in American oak, then another four in port pipes. A non chillfiltered bottling, the Quinta Ruban has a citrusy nose, with undercurrents of incense, walnuts, spice and Andes dark chocolate mint. The nose carries gracefully over to the palate, which is velvety, sweet and long. The added age is a marked improvement in intensity._NA"
620007,Laphroaig 10 Year Old Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml),"This expression offers an uncompromising note of brine-laden peat and iodine, with charcoal and sweeter fruit notes also present. The palate is equally out there, with old-fashioned fabric Band-Aids, bladderwrack seaweed, black pepper, smoldering peat, vanilla, caramel, and sweet oak. The finish is as big as everything else, with barbecue, iodine, and asphalt. Still a classic!Look for a distinctly peaty aroma, with hints of smoked fish, bacon and mesquite. The palate shows peat smoke from the first sip plus an undercurrent of honey, finishing with black pepper heat. Water brings out a spearmint note and a touch more vanilla.This 10 year old malt epitomizes the taste of Islay; rich, smoky and peaty. Known as ""the most richly flavored of all Scotch whiskies,"" Laphroaig is widely considered one of the finest distilleries in the world. That they've held that distinction for two hundred years is nothing short of awe inspiring. Laphroaig continues to maintain an on-site malting operation, which accounts for a small but significant chunk of the barley that they distill. Fermentation is conducted precisely in steel before distillation using a complex seven still system. The spirit is almost always filled into ex-bourbon barrels. The resulting whisky is one of the world's great marvels, the confluence of natures bounty and human ingenuity. You may not like the way this whisky tastes, but you sure won't ever forget it. If you do accept the siren's call to this hollow by the bay, there's fortunately no going back._Caution! And good news! True, we're trying to sell some single malt here, but to those customers who have not delved into peaty single malts much, I would counsel caution and/or patience, and here's why: I purchased the classic Laphroaig 10 early in my single malt rediscovery series...probably after the mellow Balvenie 12. Holy burning shoe leather! The level, and character of the peat is so serious, it almost made my eyes sting. So I left it alone for a long time, revisiting it from time to time. And eventually, I noticed the richness underneath. The sweet caramel. The seaweed. The beauty...of that burning shoe. By the last few drams, I was almost telling the Laphroaig 10 how sorry I was that I had misunderstood it...but I didn't have that many drams."

1497867,"2007 Cromarty's Firth (Dalmore) 13 Year Old ""Hepburn's Choice"" K&L Exclusive Single Hogshead Cask Strength Blended Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) (Pre-Arrival)","The Dalmore Distillery is in Alness, a short drive north from Inverness on the firth of Cromarty. The North Coast boasts one of the most beautiful sceneries in all of Scotland and is quickly becoming a world-renowned destination for Scotch lovers and driving enthusiasts alike. Amazingly, this is the first Dalmore we've ever bottled for the shop. We don't see much Dalmore on the open market at all and when we do it's nearly triple the price we'd ever pay. The Dalmore brand gets a bad rap from some of the whisky cognoscenti, thanks to their high prices, low abvs and ubiquitous use of caramel coloring. There's some inexplicable desire to be seen ultra-luxurious, perhaps another Macallan of sorts, but of course, there can only be one - Luxury Highlander! And so Dalmore remains relatively obscure to the broader market and our understanding of the spirit is limited because we rarely get to taste it in its natural cask strength form. Indeed, almost all the Dalmore we get has some sherry or other wine cask finish incorporated in its composition. This, on the other hand, is Dalmore 'Au Naturel.' Aged for just over 13 years in a refill hogshead and bottled, as all our single casks are, at cask strength without chill filtration or additives of any kind. The whisky is classically highland with wisps of vanilla, creamy orchard fruit, some bright refreshing maltiness and a twinge of salty sea air. This cask includes one tiny drop of  13 yo Teaninich to get us in the Blended Malt category._NA"
1492182,"2003 Macduff 14 Year Old ""The Cooper's Choice"" First Fill Single Sherry Butt Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) (Elsewhere 100)","A rare deal in Single Malt from the old Coopers Choice brand. This single sherry butt is bottled at 92 proof with no chill filtration and sells readily across the country for over $100. We've been lucky to snag the final inventory at a significantly reduced price - 30% off the suggested retail price. The Macduff Distillery is sold under the Glen Deveron  label. It's not well known, but does produce some very high-quality single malt destined for the popular blends, William Lawson and Dewars, and more recently been relaunched in a very attractive bottle by owners Bacardi. Located on the northern coast outside the town of Banff, the distillery was built in 1962. It features an somewhat unique 5 still system of 2 wash stills and 3 spirits stills. We regularly come across this malt in Scottish warehouses, but we have never had the chance to bottle one for the store that's been matured in active sherry casks. The color is a gorgeous auburn and the nose is redolent of dense dried fruit and Christmas spice. This is an easy choice for any lover of sherried Scotch and won't likely be available in this quality at this price point again in the future. One must note that the bottler seems to have labelled this as Speyside, while it's certainly not Speyside, but Highland as it sits on the banks of the River Deveron._There's no question that the world is obsessed with malt aged in dark oloroso sherry butts. It's been like this for many years and the trend is not alleviating in any way whatsoever. So we jump at the chance to sell anything that's nicely aged and when I tried this the first time, I was ready to pull the trigger on the entire cask. Then I saw that the price would be upwards of $110 on the shelf and we decided to hold off. While it's an excellent whisky and I think ultimately worth that compared to what else is on the market for this price, our customers have been predisposed to expect old malt at the over $100 price point on independently bottled malt, even when heavily sherried. So I was delighted when the importer came to us with a deal we couldn't refuse. For $70, this might be one of the year's best deals and when every other malt is going up in price, this awesome Macduff is randomly 30% less than what it's being sold for elsewhere. The color is auburn. The nose is a wonderful explosion of rum raisin and dark nut butters. Moving toward the fig compote, it offers hints of old diesel and bomber jacket. On the palate, bit of the red cherry fruit comes through along with the deep oloroso nuttiness. There's not a lot of heat at 46% but the texture is full and the finish quiet long. For any lover of sherry, there will be very few deals like this going forward even after tariffs are removed."

Martin. As Castle Black, the home of the Night's Watch, lies between Westeros and the lands to the north beyond The Wall, so does Oban sit between the west Highlands and the Islands of Scotland._NA"

They are hyper focused on locally sourcing all of their ingredients from the beautiful Cotswolds area of oustanding beauty in England. This means they use 100% floor-malted locally sourced barley for their whisky. Long fermentations and a double pot distillation results in a very rich, textural whisky with elegant fruit and floral forward malt nose and palate. Natural in color and non-chill filtered and bottled at a firm 46% ABV, this malt offers something that is familiar yet decidedly different from its northern brethren._NA"
1382660,"Kujira Ryukyu 20 Year Old ""Bourbon Cask"" Japanese Whisky (750ml)","Founded in 1952, Kumesen Syuzo produces a distilled spirit known as Awamori that is made entirely with rice and is unique to the Okinawa islands of Japan. It's typically aged for just a few years and consumed at lower proof, but the distillery began experimenting with higher proof aging in ex-bourbon casks in 1989. The results are stocks of extremely old single grain whisky. The age and the American oak set this whisky apart from most of the other rice whiskies on the market because both create a depth and complexity that are not present in the younger products. Still lighter bodied than a single malt, but with a powerful nose of fresh spices, plum preserves, and candied mint. The palate is medium bodied with tons of wood spice and dense vanilla bean. The finish stays dry and warms up slightly to a long herbaceous finish. A welcome, if unusual, addition to the growing Japanese whisky category._NA"

One of the last family distilleries in Scotland, it is owned by the Grants who have been involved in its operations since at least 1865. These days, the distillery is a shiny beacon of hope for lovers of great and affordable whisky, which is a rarity in these times. The Grants are committed to releasing high quality whisky without all the frills like crystal decanters, at prices affordable to most single malt aficionados._The very special Glenfarclas 21 year, like the entire line from the special distillery outside of Aberlour, is an exquisite value. Having recently retasted the 21, I felt compelled to reiterate just how delicious it actually is. 'Farclas has tons of richness in all its offerings, but the 21 seems to be the most vibrant and alive of the standard offerings. Tons of rich tropical fruit and sherry spice without a ton of raisin or prune. The richness on the palate should be noted as well as the complex blend of fruit, spice and fudge. I'm absolutely in love with this one and recent bottlings are tasting better and better."

Bold, yet elegant.Glengoyne is one of Scotland's most underrated distilleries, and they have made a commitment to revamping their image into one of the highest-quality malts available.

1203645,"Nikka ""Taketsuru"" Pure Malt Japanese Whisky (750ml)","The luxe aroma mixes rich butterscotch and apple sweetness. On the palate, this whisky is light and gentle, interspersing fruit and smoke and finishing with a spark of cinnamon heat. Add a splash of water; recommended for sipping.So you've heard that Japanese whisky is quite popular these days. You're right; it is. But while the mainstream choice is always going to be Suntory, it's Nikka that is quietly bringing the goods to your local boutique retailer. Founded by Masataka Taketsuru in 1936, the Nikka whisky company is one of Japan's best kept secrets . Taketsuru studied whisky production in Scotland during the 1910s and brought that knowledge back to Nippon to make Scottish-style whisky at home.  Nikka's Pure Malt Taketsuru is a marriage of single malts from both the Yoichi distillery on Hokkaido, and the Miyagikyo distillery near Sendai. Using a formula of different flavors - sherry, malty, vanillic - made from whiskies aged in different types of casks, the aromas are heady and full of oily grains. The palate is soft, supple and fruity with a shift toward sherry and vanilla at the back. Bring this to a party and you'll be the star. Most people have never had it, so pour it blind and watch them guess that it's Macallan._I was pretty bummed to hear that the U.S. market would not be getting the 12 year Taketsuru any longer and skeptical that a no age statement replacement would be acceptable. I was wildly mistaken. While the 12 year seemed safe and predictable, there's something wild and untamed about the NAS. While it doesn't have an age, the supplier says it's around 10ish -- I do think it's got more depth and complexity than the whisky it replaces. Hopefully they'll be able to keep this in good supply 'cause this is solid drinking for a good price."

We made a concious decision to bottle all our single cask malts from this line as blended malt, adding a tiny drop of another distillery to the cask, thereby reclassifying it and saving everyone tons of cheese! More proof of that plan coming together exists in this awesome bottle. We were barely able to sell a 9 year old Mortlach last year from the same bottler for under $60, now we can offer a 13 year old version for nearly the same price. The awesome Mortlach Distillery is in Dufftown. Dufftown's gaelic name is Baile Bhainidh , or the Lucky Town! Mortlach sits to the south of Dufftown's more famous distilleries Balvenie and Glenfiddich, in a hollow that nearly hides it completely from view from the road. It was, infact, the first legal distillery in this special town founded in 1823 on the site of an illicit still, hence the hollow. The distillery features an unusual 2.81 times distillation, long fermentation times and worm tub cooling resulting in an uncommonly beefy spirit. But this youngish Mortlach offers another side of the excellent malt. Filled into a refill hoggie in 2007, it offers some serious fruit along with a deep malty spice.

Keep a light hand on the water, this washes out easily.Still holding our super low price on this classic Islay whisky, which was named World Whisky of the Year by Jim Murray in his 2008 edition of the Whisky Bible, making it easier for you, too, to fall in love with the peat and the toffee richness that accompany the power and complexity of this spirit._The south side of Islay is filled with magical places and none more so than the little inlet just beyond Lagavulin Bay. Ardbeg has been the darling of whisky geeks and professional drinkers for many years now, but the most astonishing thing about it is that we've keep the price low. Every other brand sees an explosion and works quickly to get their prices up. Ardbeg, however, have worked closely with us to keep their products affordable despite an incredible increase in popularity. Only the Laphroaig 10 year rivals this whisky for affordable heavily peated single malt and while Ardbeg doesn't match Laphroaig for power and intensity, it does deliver an absolutely unique and altogether elegant version of the typical south shore profile (i.e. SMOKE). This is the perfect whisky to cut your smoke tooth on and should be a staple in any serious drinkers repertoire.

                Still the best deal for 10 year old whisky. Still the best deal for peated whisky. Still the best deal in whisky--period. I'm never without a bottle on my bar. A true classic of the single genre. You're never too cool, too rich, too knowledgeable, or too refined for Ardbeg 10.

                How does one judge a fine drink? My father and I have talked about this subject a lot, and one of his key questions is, ""would I return to it?"" With this expression of Ardbeg, my answer is a big yes. Susan just sold me a bottle of what will be the sixth expression of Ardbeg in my liquor cabinet at present. I love this distillery, and jump at the chance to buy each new bottling that comes our way... Yet I am drawn back most often to the distillery ten. It is the lightest, the brightest, the most untamed by wood and time of all of the Ardbegs we carry. It is full of peat - My wife Cinnamon can often smell it from across the room as I pour and will complain about it. So, don't by it for someone who does not like peat - they will hate it! I am sure that I return to it because it has the peat flavor that I love, but without the oily heaviness that I don't want after a big meal, and after a big meal is when I want Scotch the most. Don’t get me wrong, I love the variety and still drink my other bottles (all of which were more expensive), but I just empty this one fastest. It is delicious, and well worth the modest price."

This small outfit has become an increasingly important player in the sale and bottling of small scale lots of high quality Scotch. The Munros line is a reference to Scotland's 282 mountains over 3000 feet. Explorers across the UK had long considered climbing each peak a rite of passage and likewise the great malts represent the heights of achievement in the eyes of whisky lovers across the world. The Braeval Distillery  was built in the early 1970s to help sustain the growth of the popular Chivas Brand. It has yet to be sold by the owners regularly as a single malt, but we've had success with a few from various independent bottlers over the years. Here the malty fruity character of the spirit is heightened perfectly after over two decades in fresh American Bourbon barrels. Like all the Munros this is a small batch of sequential casks and bottled without chill filtration or reduction of any kind. Expect a very easy drinking speysider focused on fruity malt, vanillas and subtle spices. A gorgeous example of this unsung little distillery._Another young, but relatively well liked distillery, this one is distinct across the Munros line in that it was aged in exclusively ex-bourbon barrels. The already clean and fruity style of the Braeval (previously called Braes of Glenlivet) works perfectly with the round subtle American oak and sweet flavors imparted by these great bourbon barrels. The color is pale gold. The nose has the perfect blend of yellow and orange fruits, hints of fresh apricots and mirabelle. Touches of roasted almond and toasted vanilla bean heighten the clean fruitiness perfectly. On the palate lemon candies, white pepper, cherry pits, ground clove and tiniest hints of  fresh bread yeasty quality. Certainly not a whisky that's going to scare anyone away, as it's round and approachable, but by no means one note or boring. This is as quintessentially Speyside as any malt in our selection right now and offers and incredible value for a relatively rare distillery."

With this utterly unique single malt made from the historic Bere barley variety, Bruichladdich reexamines whisky flavors starting with the raw material. Herbal pine bough, salted almond, and tropical fruit appear on the nose, followed by a creamy mouthfeel with intense chocolate, pepper, citrus oil, pine sap, and perfumy chamomile flavors. The full, round finish has rose petal, white pepper, and vanilla overlaying a delicate but pronounced structure. - SSBWe've always loved the Bere expression from Bruichladdich, but now it's finally getting recongnized for the exquisite quality and unique character that we've always known it to prosess. #15 on the Whisky Advocate Top Whiskies of 2019 List_NA"

One has become so ubiquitous that it's name does not even connote Scotch any longer, but simply luxury. The other is the rugged and rustic dark horse  Craigellachie. They're putting out some of the very best malt anywhere in Scotland to little fanfare. The still house has been reconstructed in the modern era and looks similar to Glendronach's, a stone and glass box, which isn't so pretty from the outside, but gives the distiller plenty of air and space to work. It wasn't until recently that the owners, Bacardi, began marketing this excellent malt on its own although the vast majority of this whisky still ends up in the Dewars blend. Built in 1891 on the cliffs across from Macallan, if you miss the turn off to Dufftown, you'll miss Craigellachie, but the next road takes you right to the Highlander Inn. There you should stop and taste the local dram of choice. Or save a trip and try this awesome little cask. Age for 14 years in a refill sherry butt, the malt has all the classic hallmarks of this awesome distillery. Dense and chewy, without being totally overtaken by the sherry, the malt offers plenty of deep herbal character, powerful savory spice and complex cacao flavors. This malt was teaspooned with a homeopathic quantities Dailuaine to declassify it, but the flavors and quality remains at the highest level._NA"
1499782,"2010 Islay Straight (Caol Ila) 10 Year Old ""Sovereign"" K&L Exclusive Single Sherry Butt Finish Cask Strength Blended Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) (Pre-Arrival)","Anyone who has taken the fairy to the Isle of Islay from Kennacraig to Port Askaig has seen this special distillery from a unique vantage point. As you motor up the Islay Straight to the port the ferry begins a big sweeping turn into harbor and you get a spectacular view off the starboard side of Caol Ila’s warehouses and massive distillery. It’s a special introduction to the spectacular beauty of Islay. If you were to skip the port and carry on up the straight you find Bunnahabhain, and so it was a natural choice for the teaspoon of liquid gold we needed to add to the cask and bring the price of this 10 year down far below the $100 mark.

After the extraordinary quality and popularity of the 2019 release, we knew something good would be coming in 2020 from Glen Scotia. Well, it's reached California, and in very small amounts. We secured most of the state's inventory of this beauty, and when it's gone we expect we won't see a second shot this year. Distilled in 2006, the Glen Scotia ‘Tawny Port’ Festival Edition is a peated Campbeltown Malt that has been matured in a mix of refill American hogsheads, medium char American oak and first fill bourbon barrels before being finished in first fill Tawny Port hogsheads and then bottled at cask strength 52.8% ABV. The nose shows blackberry, floral notes of rose and ocean spray and a faint trace of smoke. The palate has a silky mouthfeel, crisp green apple, peach syrup and vanilla with a honey sweetness. The finish really shows the gentle peat smoke of Glen Scotia along with a wide array of sweet port fruits, black currant and raspberries mix with clove and cooking spice._Ahhh one of my favorite producers, Glen Scotia has hit it out of the ballpark again with this tawny port cask aged malt that gives off hibiscus, light oak and toasted grains on the nose while providing a heavy viscous mouthfeel. On the palate I get notes of orange flower, spices and dark cherries with a dusting of peat characters. Exploding with fun flavors, you'll be nosing this malt all night long with your friends as you divulge into the nuanced flavors this Glen Scotia has to offer. A must buy!"
1502892,"1993 Springbank 25 Year Old ""The Perfect Fifth"" First Fill Sherry Butt No. 315 Cask Strength Single Malt Island Scotch Whisky (750ml)","An absolute gem in the Perfect Fifth line up. At 96 points it's close to the legendary Highland Park they've also bottled, but for half the price. Jim Murray says, ""Anyone who remembers the old Springbank 25-year-olds of the early 1990s will recognise this aroma as a direct descendent - indeed it is near enough identical in both weight and character. The huge, nuggety oak is faultless  teases away as a barely audible background noise, which automatically becomes louder the moment you spot it. Taste: A malt on the threshold of perhaps dallying too closely with the oak. But that coastal-style bite makes just the right contact with the salty tannins and cocoa laden phenol to make a course for more complex and satisfying port. Just enough oil makes the middle rich and promises a long finale. Finish: Drier, as is to be expected, as the tannins raise their game. Still salty, but a little barley sugar and lemon juice lightens the intensity, though - happily, by not too much; the residual oils ensure the finish is of extraordinary length. Balance: A real return to the past here with Springbank in its most full-bodied, uncompromising and complex style which those of us who discovered the distillery in the 1980s remember with great affection.""_NA"
620175,Old Pulteney 12 Year Old Single Malt Whisky (750ml),"The only survivor from Old Pulteney’s core range shake-up of 2018, this has been matured in first and second-fill bourbon casks. The nose is delicate, with almonds, honey, and floral notes. Malt and toffee on the palate, with spicy oak and a hint of brine. The medium-length finish is nutty, with wood spices.The Old Pulteney distillery is the most northerly distillery on the Scottish mainland, situated in the town of Wick. Your nose and palate discern complex combinations, robust yet delicate with a hint of sea air._From the furthest northeast distillery in the Highland region, Old Pulteney has garnered somewhat of a cult following, and for good reason. This Highland finished in ex-bourbon casks opens with a rather densely fruited nose. Notes of dried apricot lay alongside hints of saline and salt. Underscored by a delicate barbecue smoke, with fairly light heat on the finish, this is a lovely little whiskey to sip on as spring unfolds."
620104,Aberlour 16 Year Old Speyside Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml),"The bouquet is austere and leathery with curious aromas of beeswax, vegetable oil and oaky resin. Palate entry is focused on the resin; midpalate is splendidly multilayered and offers elements of black pepper, dried orange blossom, honeysuckle, dried fruit, sage, fennel and confections. Aftertaste is deep and unabashedly sweet and honeyed.Both bourbon and sherry casks were used for aging. Stewed fruits, butterscotch, and soft spices on the nose. Silky palate delivery, with honey, dark chocolate, light sherry, and cloves. Lingering finish, with citrus and allspice.At age 16, the Aberlour seems to possess maturity that may appeal to a broad spectrum of whisky fans. An aroma as enticing as freshly baked apple pie isn't come by easily in whisky; the blend of ""traditional"" and sherry casks helps — but the vibrant fruitiness of the Aberlour 16 is a phenomenon that demands to be experienced directly._Apple pie is right--or more like hot apple cider, for me. Warm, spicy holiday punch, with ginger and cinnamon and delicious, caramel and apple flavor. Not as hot and spicy as the A'Bunadh, the dignified Aberlour 16 is a rich, smooth, and delightful companion to, say, a good book; to be sipped and savored.

                What would you expect from this great distillery who's popularity keeps growing and growing?  Classic speyside- the 16 year is especially rich and malty, with salted caramel flavors and a long, pure finish.  Decadent and delicious!"
1051653,"Ardbeg ""Corryvreckan"" Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) (Elsewhere $82)","Powerful, muscular, well-textured, and invigorating. Even within the realm of Ardbeg, this one stands out. The more aggressive notes of coal tar, damp kiln, anise, and smoked seaweed are supported by an array of fruit2009 Scotch Whisky of the Year from the Malt Advocate.   Named for Europe's largest whirlpool, this whisky is now available on a full-time basis, having replaced the beloved Beist. Like the whirlpool, Ardbeg Corryvreckan is heady, intense and powerful. Its finish is long and deep, leaving the sipper with a lingering, mysterious and enticing taste. It is without a doubt one of the best Ardbegs ever created and lends a bit of richness to balance out the spicy flavors. Lots of peat, lots of power, but always perfectly balanced. A malt to really savor._For sure, the next time I have enough spare change to be able to decide between purchasing a Talisker 18 or the Corry, I am likely to experience some cognitive dissonance--and I mean before I have had any whisky! UPDATE: After first sampling the Corryvreckan, I was able to purchase a bottle and am very happy with it. This whisky presents luxe aromas of vanilla, caramel, and a hint of chocolate liqueur, haunted by a roasted seaweed, smoked fish and bacon sort of peatiness. If you've tried the Ardbeg 10 but felt it was just somewhat too aggressively peaty for you, at least for now, check out this one. It's got all the soft, lovely smoky beauty of a Talisker Distiller's, say, but with a spicier, cinnamon mint finish--like a younger Islay, like our Kilchoman single barrels, for instance. If you don't mind a hot finish, and love a single malt that tantalizes your nose with seductive, smoky and sweet aromas, this is it.
            |
                Another great addition to the line of single malts from Ardbeg. The Corryvreckan has the famous Ardbeg smoke and peat but is a unique product in its own right. The mouth feel is rich and round with more weight than I had expected. This blends very nicely with the smoke and peat to make one great beverage."
620058,Glenfarclas 25 Year Old Distillery Bottling Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml),"Glenfarclas is special for more than its stunning location. One of the last family distilleries in Scotland, it is owned by the Grants, who have been involved in its operations since at least 1865. These days the distillery is a shining beacon of hope for lovers of great, affordable whisky--a rarity in these times. The Grants are committed to releasing high-quality whisky without all the frills like crystal decanters, at prices affordable to most single malt aficionados. While certainly not cheap, their 25-year and 40-year-old malts cost a fraction of their rivals’ whiskies, and they often blow the others out of the water in terms of quality. One of Speyside’s most classic sherried malts  Tasting notes from the distillery: ""Colour: Amber with dark gold highlights. Nose: Complex, yet refined, delicately peated, with fresh tempting aromas of marmalade, honey, freshly ground coffee, sherry and nuts. Some oaky tannins. Flavour: Full-bodied and robust, the sherry and the oak fight for your attention yet neither is overpowering. A powerful nutty smokiness. Finish: Intense, long lasting, dry smoky and malty. A beautiful dark Belgium chocolate taste at the back of your mouth to complete the flavour of the 25 Years Old. Comment: A great after-dinner whisky so rich and full that it is a dessert in itself, with a finish that goes on forever.""_It's still astonishing that this whisky is on the shelf for $150. Just absolutely flabbergasted by the continued price/quality ratio here, even while their competitors are raising prices every quarter. Glenfarclas is of course one of my favorite distilleries, not only because it's producing some of the most consistent and delicious malt in Scotland, but also because of the magnanimous family that's owner is for centuries - The Grants. The 25 year is the Grant's flagship product, often compared to their neighbors the Macallan, but truly in a class of it's own. While 'Farclas has a great amount of Sherry butts in this blend, unlike the Macallan, their not married to only using that type of cask. The result is something that is big and bold enough for a Mac drinker to appreciate, but with a subtle complexity that the most discerning palates could spend hours analyzing. And then there's is the price. Not even Scotland' WORST distilleries sell their 25 year old for anywhere close to this bad boy. This is unequivocally the best value in mature Scotch...maybe ever."

Balvenie is one of the few distillers to retain traditional distilling and malting practices. They dry their barley over a mixture of light peat and anthracite coal which create a complexity that industrial maltsers electrically heated fans cannot mimic. While it's not peaty after years in barrel, it does offer complexity unmatched by other Speysiders. These single barrels have spent 15 years in fresh first fill European Oak Oloroso Sherry Butts thereby complementing the incredibly complex spirit of the Balvenie Distillery with the rich flavors of that special Spanish wine. For many of the distillery's aficionados this is now the quintessential expression. Producer note: ""The Balvenie 15 Year Old Single Barrel Sherry Cask is a celebration of the unique and mysterious interaction between oak, spirit and time. This exceptional whisky is matured exclusively in a European oak sherry butt for at least 15 years. And while each cask is subtly different—Malt Master David Stewart hand selects each barrel for its flavor of dried fruits, nuts and spice. No more than 650 hand-numbered bottles are drawn from each sherry butt, making every bottling unique and unrepeatable. The Balvenie 15 Year Old Single Barrel is bottled at a higher strength of 47.8% ABV.""_This is without a doubt the most exciting new product from Balvenie since the wildly collectable Tun 1401 series. Now, what makes this so interesting, despite the full term in Sherry, is that they're bottling these without filtration at slightly higher proof. That means we've got the ultra rich oily texture that's so important for appreciating this special distillery. Of course, each cask is different, but every one I've tasted so far has been exceptional."
1485014,"1993 Glen Keith 24 Year Old ""Munros"" K&L Exclusive Cask Strength Unchillfiltered Speyside Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","The lovely small batch bottlings in the ""Munros"" line up are selected by the small Glasgow Whisky Company and represent some of the best values in single malt scotch today. This small outfit has become an increasingly important player in the sale and bottling of small scale lots of high quality Scotch. The Munros line is a reference to Scotland's 282 mountains over 3000 feet. Explorers across the UK had long considered climbing each peak a rite of passage and likewise the great malts represent the heights of achievement in the eyes of whisky lovers across the world. This exceptional expression of the famous Speyside distillery, Glen Grant, was distilled entirely on July 26th, 1995. Filled into refill American oak ex-bourbon barrels, it's been allowed more than 22 years to mature in the cool climate of northern Scotland. Bottled on the 30th of October, 2017 without chill filtration, the addition of water or color whatsoever. The resulting whisky is one of the most honest and quintessential expressions of the classic Speyside style available. A cornucopia of dried fruit, sweet cereal, orchard fruit and creamy texture makes this the perfect whisky for any occasion. Thanks to incredible work securing these stocks and unbelievable prices, we're able to offer the Munros line-up significantly below market value. While this is an exclusive in California for K&L, you might see the same bottle in other markets fetching upwards of $200. This 24 year old was aged in ""dump hogsheads""._The excellent and affordable whiskies from Munros are unique in that they're dumping small batches of two to four barrels. IN this case they've married a tiny lot of ""dump hogsheads,"" which I believe refers to a dumpy or squat hogshead. this is a barrel composed of slightly shorter staves giving the barrel squat look and resulting typically in a higher oak to whisky ration (210-220 liters vs the standard 250). In any case, the resulting whisky is lovely extremely classic Keith. The color is pale gold. The nose is zesty and fresh, with hints of citrus peel, crystal malt, and fresh bitter herbs (hints of wormwood and orris). Great texture on the palate, with an almost buttery consistency, and now some more vanilla. The citrus fruit leans slightly toward grapefruit with some fresh stone and orchard fruit coming in as well. The finish brings back some of the tangy herbal quality, but refrains from feeling bitter - dried mint, anis, exotic spices and orange blossom honey. A truly lovely drinkable classic Keith for an outstanding price."

The nose is briny and smoky, with a seaweed character; lemon poppyseed muffin and almond cake are present without water.

1199225,Westland Sherry Wood American Single Malt Whiskey (750ml),"Made from 100% malted barley and aged in former sherry casks, this amber whiskey has a dry, bracing scent brushed with dried apricot and brown sugar. Just a splash of water brings out custard-like notes, alongside vanilla, chamomile tea and stone fruit, finishing with a wisp of smoke.Seattle’s Westland Distillery may be the country’s foremost producer of American single-malt whiskey, especially considering its most recent releases. The Peated blends a heavily peated spirit with a mash of fruity, grainy Washington-grown pale malt to give a whiskey with the smoky snarl of peat that’s elegantly tucked into a smooth, harmonious drink. The Sherry Wood whiskey shows a similar touch, the maple and toffee hallmarks of Sherry oak present but not overwhelming.Sweet vanilla, dried berries, and a soft display of woodsmoke introduce this whiskey. While notably improved from earlier bottlings, the sherry is still rendered a bit dull, like chocolate-covered cherries, as smoky cocoa nibs and the chewy malt meet on the palate, offering a honeyed finish with hints of baking chocolate.Seattle's single malt sensation Westland Distillery is back with a new expression aged in sherry that mimics some of the finest and most beloved Speyside malts from Scotland's Highland region. In the style of Macallan or Glenfarclas, the supple, soft, fudgy, cocoa flavors are more pronounced from the sherry maturation and the richness of the palate is enhanced beyond what we've seen in the standard Westland expression. It's a more decadent version of what we already love about America's top single malt distillery and an exciting glimpse into what's promising to be a very bright future._The fact that this bottle comes from perhaps the coolest distillery in the United States right now, and the fact that it is priced at under $75 are only really relevant if it is good. Fortunately for everyone involved, from the makers to the drinkers, it is very good indeed. A rich nose of loads of dense fruit, hints of smoke, a little vanilla and nuttiness and this all in the initial sniff. The body holds all the the smell of this whiskey promises, the sherry casking adding it's compounding notes of pecan and mocha to the toasted vanilla and baked fruit of the whiskey. Spices on the finish with some heat keep this whiskey long in the memory. In short, it is beautiful.
            |
                My personal favorite of our current Westland lineup.  Aromas of Fig Newtons,  toasted pecan, mocha and dried yellow fruits to cap it off.   It isn't too oily or sweet, it's an honest, lively whiskey that begs to be had neat, or with a single rock.    
            |
                A tasty West Coast single malt that is easy to drink and enjoy. The sherry aging adds some richness, making this version of Westland single malt a juicy and round spirit. A delectable delight to have straight or with some ice.
            |
                Same Westland intensity, balance and quality but wrapped up in decadent Christmas cake spices, dried fruit, lovely nutty rancio tones and with a softer edge of caramelized berries. Great texture and layers of flavor. The best American Single Malt that has passed my lips thus far.
            |
                The Westland Sherry Aged Single Malt  is incredibly expressive and complex. The influence from the sherry gives a beautiful fruity aspect along with vanilla and warm spices. The palate is powerful and has a slightly spicy finish. Definitely do not miss this one, it’s a hit. 
            |
                A stunning sherry expression that really redefines my entire perception of American single malt. This is incredible stuff, on the level of some of the younger Glendronach and Aberlour single whiskies from Scotland. Westland is already on another level that all other American single malt distilleries. Based on this incredible whiskey, I have to think it's only a few more years before they're completely dominant. Buy in now, while the gettin's good. That's my advice.
            |
                One of the best American Single Malts I have tasted, period. Westland is doing everything properly, no corners cut, the proper still, and high quality wood, each of these factors going in to creating a whisky that is every bit as good as its Scottish counterparts. Full of sherry richness, dates, sweet roasted pecans, and lush mahogany notes, like a fine library. The quality of the sherry really jumped out of the glass--I find that smaller producers often have overall a much better quality of wood due to the fact they are not buying lots of hundreds of barrels, so the essence of sherry barrels are more purely expressed.  For Mac 12 fans, this is an exciting local alternative that really offers a ton of quality."
1169645,Westland American Single Malt Whiskey (750ml),"Westland's flagship single malt is aged for two years and bottled at 92 proof. It has a topaz hue and rich caramel aroma. On the palate, it's a bit oaky at first, but soon opens up to echo that bold caramel, plus a smoky touch of burnt orange peel on the slightly hot finish. Adding water brings out a faint almond note too.The flagship whiskey for Seattle's Westland Distillery is one of the first American single malts that actually tastes like Scottish single malt. At the core of this whiskey’s flavor profile is a grain bill of five different roasted and kilned barley malts, giving the malt a character that's Scotch-like, but still distinctly different. The base is a pale malt, grown in the state of Washington. To that they add specialty malts, a concept inspired by the vibrant craft brewing culture of the Pacific Northwest. Belgian brewer’s yeast further enhances flavor development, creating fruity esters during fermentation. And finally, maturing predominantly in the finest new American oak casks complements these choices with vanilla, caramel and coconut notes, leaving an approachable and mature whiskey that's shockingly mature despite its young age._The fact that Westland makes an amazing whiskey is no longer knew news, but hearing about it and tasting it are two different things. The Westland American Oak is reminiscent of many of my favorite single malts from Scotland and still it's own animal. Vanilla and a hints of fruit in the nose lead to a creamy vanilla, butterscotch, and coffee palate. This does not taste like a new distillery from the US, this tastes like someone has been crafting this whiskey for years in some country older than ours. 
            |
                Westland's American Single Malt is truly a show stopper.  It houses very pure single malt Scotch-like characteristics (reminiscent of a classic Speyside) while adding some additional notes of vanilla extract, espresso bean and dried Medjool dates.  This could be a game changer for you, come scoop a bottle and you'll understand what I'm talking about.

                The great American single malt has finally arrived and it's being made in Seattle, Washington. Don't believe me? Get a bottle and see for yourselves. This is made on real Forsyth pot stills just like in Scotland, aged in bourbon and sherry casks, and brimming with Macallan-like flavor. It's still a bit young, but man is it going to get better. 
            |
                I guess you would call this the ""Flagship"" of Westland...? Not necessarily because it's the best but because this is a blend of sherry and bourbon casks...it's the complete flavor profile of what they do. This does a seriously good impression of seriously good Scotch...and yet it is distinct also. It seems richer, more intense and ""malty"" than most Scotch. I love the intensity. It also has good nuance and balance...the wood doesn't dominate the purity and brightness of the spirit. Chewy textured and long on the palate, proof is just right. A must try.
            |
                Now here's a truly distinct and cool American whisky hailing from Seattle that will capture the hearts of craft whisky drinkers and beer nerds alike.
Mixing tried and true old style Scottish pot distilling techniques with uniquely Pacific Northwestern malts and Belgian brewers yeast, Westland produces a libation with complex aromas — rich with scents reminiscent of fruit and spices. The body is robust yet smooth and easy-drinking with healthy doses of root beer and cocoa. This is delicious and a must for super, satisfying sipping. American single malt is here folks, take a dram.

                I hardly need to second the choices of David, but wow this one is very cool!  Its rich, deep color at first made me worry that this was going to be a little too woody and sweet, but the nose suddenly changed that.  Very full and deep with a somewhat roasted nut nose, and on the palate it has nice, long walnut, vanilla, barley and subtle raisin and caramel notes.  Delicious and mouth-filling, yet vibrant and zesty.  It has just enough sweet notes and a fantastic finish.  The closest I've seen to a single malt Scotch from the U.S.!"

Well done!_I love Islay Malt, but find that many of them just end up filling up my liquor cabinet, as I am not drawn to drinking them the same way that I am impressed by tasting them. The Classic Laddie Scottish Barley from Bruichladdich is not at like that, and is super drinkable and moreish. This is the perfect malt for having a second dram of, since the fabulously salty complexity does not come with a bunch of excessive fat and heat.

1052294,Compass Box Spice Tree Blended Malt Whisky (750ml),"The tastiest of their Signature range, this boasts a dry oak and spice nose with fudge, rye bread, and banana interwoven with French oak influences of nutmeg, cinnamon, and ground ginger. As the gentle orange, malt, pear, and apple settle down, little spicy explosions of ginger and pepper detonate, leaving an aftermath of spiced malt, coffee cake, milk chocolate, and cocoa. Such a wonderful flavor trajectory to behold.A few years ago, John Glaser traveled to the Vosges forest to visit a mill that makes oak for cooperage. He was in search of the highest quality cooperage oak in the world, as he planned to begin buying his own casks to fill with new spirit. He found a mill that makes oak for cooperage from slow growth, 195-year-old French Sessile oak, which they air-dry outdoors for at least two years to season and evolve the flavors in the wood. They use this oak for making some of the most expensive wine barrels in the world, but they also use the same oak to make flat oak barrel inserts  And his second batch, released in April 2006, was entirely pre-sold to importers before it was bottled!

1334900,"Auchentoshan ""Bartender's Malt Edition 1"" Lowland Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","Auchentoshan named this whisky the ""Bartender's Malt"" because it was designed and blended by a team of twelve different bartenders from all over the world who helped to select the barrels. Here's the really compelling part: they used single malt whisky from the 1970s, '80s, '90s, 2000s, and current decade in the blend, from ex-bourbon, ex-sherry, ex-wine, and even German oak barrels! Innovative blends like this are what's going to drive the business moving forward, in our opinion, especially in a market where single barrel pricing is proving to be cost prohibitive and access is getting more and more difficult. For a very affordable price, this is a drinker's whisky. It is absolutely jam-packed with sweet barley flavor, loads of vanilla, spicy ginger, candied orange peel, and a symphony of oak and baking spices on the finish that light up your mouth for minutes with distinct and supple flavors of milk chocolate. Bottled at 47% ABV, it's got punch as well. This was our spirits buyer's new house single malt when it first arrived, and his highest recommendation here for a sub-$50 malt. Bravo!_My first experience tasting this whiskey was when David Driscoll poured it for me blind. My immediate reaction was: ""well that's delicious, what's it cost, about 100 bucks?"" When he told me it was well under $50 I walked downstairs and bought a bottle without saying another word. It's been an absolute go to ever since. The whisky itself is a blend of 5 decades of malt in all different types of barrels hand selected from Auchentoshan's warehouses by 12 of the world's best bartenders. The results are incredible. The whisky is fruity, malty, spicy, and sweet all at once. The elegant nature of the spirit produced by Auchentoshan's triple distillation makes this the perfect whisky for summer. The richness from all the different types of wood and ages makes it perfect for sipping. And the crazy price makes it the best possible base for your next cocktail. I recommend a Rob Roy.

                This collaboration of many minds and mouths should appeal to many people. It is soft and round and very easy to drink. On the light side there is a a touch of dried fruit flavors in the mid palate. Alone or on the rocks this will make a delicious drink for when one does not want to analyse and think about it, but wants to just enjoy.

                There was a time when certain things were simply not done. One would never mix a fine single malt into something so crass as a cocktail.  I come from a bar background and will happily mix up great spirits into great cocktails. Fortunately for me, that rigid way of thinking is becoming more flexible and certain distilleries are embracing this trend. Auchentoshen is a perfect example, a blend of selected casks from different bartenders the whisky itself is beautiful. Soft, clean, supple, with beautiful vanilla, citrus, peaches, and white chocolate plus the texture that triple distilled Auchentoshan brings this is a delightful whisky all by itself. However, this is also a blend created by bartenders and for the bar. It is priced perfectly to allow someone to get creative, or go for a classic scotch and soda. If you are feeling daring maybe do what I am planning on doing this summer and mixing it with lemon juice, ginger syrup and floating a mellow IPA on top for a fantastic shandy."

620002,Highland Park 12 Year Old Isle of Orkney Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml),"Elegant, light and pretty. This amber spirit has a light, briny vanilla scent and a silky feel. A veil of smoke rises through the Scotch , leaving behind a sweet nutty, vanilla finish.Highland Park 12 Year Old boasts individuality and complexity, thanks in part to the use of Orcadian peat in the distillery floor maltings and the employment of ex-sherry casks for maturation. The nose is fragrant and floral, with hints of heather and some spice. Smooth and honeyed on the palate, with citrus fruits, malt, and distinctive tones of wood smoke in the warm, lengthy, slightly peaty finish.Highland Park, one of only two distilleries in the Orkney Isles, is the world's most northerly whisky distillery. It was founded in 1798 by Magnus Euson. Until it was licensed in 1825, its production was illicit and Euson was assisted in evading the excisemen by a kinsman who was a Kirk elder, and hid the contraband under the pulpit. By the 1880s, Highland Park had an established reputation and at one time both the King of Denmark and the Emperor of Russia declared it to be the finest whisky they had ever tasted. Highland Park has been described as the greatest all-rounder in the world of malt whisky. Its product retains much that is traditional, even original. It has its own floor maltings and peat beds and two traditional peat-fired kilns. Many believe the unique character of Highland Park comes from the local peat beds which have absorbed the salt spray of centuries and which impart a rooty, heathery quality to the whisky. Only a carefully measured amount is used to fire the kiln for each malting. Oak casks are then used for the maturation process. As a single malt, Highland Park matures superbly. In blends, it is said to be a catalyst, bringing its best to other malts._Highland Park remains a sleeper despite the some international attention, it hasn't achieved the heights the it's sister distillery in Speyside has. Perhaps that's because it comes from the far flung Isle of Orkney or maybe it's just that HP isn't as flashy as her Sherried southern sister. Highland Park has been consistently producing some of the best malts anywhere in the world since 1798. Traditionally, Highland Park (many years ago) was a big smoky sooty oily funky monsters. In modern times the distillery has adopted a more subtle style. I guess the move away from floor maltings has increase it's availability and consistency. What's great about modern HP 12 is one of those slightly peated malts that almost anyone can appreciate. When someone asks for something with just a little bit of smoke, we really don't have a lot of options. With HP 12 you can expect a nose fresh malt, sweet honey, slight green woodsy quality and the slightest smoldering peat left over night in the hearth. The Island vibe is not lost in HP and a soft briny note is present throughout. The palate remains on the malty side with the peat taking a back seat and the real highland character turning up. All in all a lovely little offering the remains quite affordable from this historic distillery. 
            |
                The malty, soft, cereal grain and butterscotch aroma of the Highland Park 12 is imbued with a whisper of peat that draws one in to a deeper place. For me, it's the long-ago memory of an oceanside cottage--opening the door, the cupboards, the aroma was always familiar and comforting yet distant, salty, and of the sea. That's Highland Park, to me: a straightforward butter cookie of a whisky, but the window's open just a crack, and you can smell the sea and heather coming in."

The Double Barrel is an eleven year old malt aged in both French and American oak that is reminiscent of lighter, unsherried Highland whisky. Soft vanilla notes, creamy textures, and subtle grains permeate the palate. The price may seem a bit high at first, but it's actually line priced with similar American craft whiskies of the same age.  Comprised of two French Oak ex-tawny  casks, this batch is a classic example of the Sullivans Cove style. Bottled at 45% abv, this whisky has all the creamy texture, warm fruits and sweet malty notes Sullivans Cove is known for, resulting in a rich and complex but very friendly and approachable single malt._NA"
1275759,Kilkerran (Glengyle) 12 Year Old Campbeltown Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml),"After six ‘Work in Progress’ releases, Kilkerran from Glengyle Distillery has finally come of age with this core expression. It comprises 70% whisky from first-fill bourbon casks and 30% from sherry casks. Floral on the nose, with honey and a hint of brine, then peaty fruit notes develop. The palate is confident and oily, slightly earthy, with tinned peaches, black pepper, cinnamon, smoke, and a suggestion of medicine chests. The finish is relatively long, with pepper, licorice, and drying oak.When the doors opened at the Mitchell's Glengyle Distillery in March of 2004, it became the first new distillery to open in Campbeltown in more than 125 years. Campbeltown, once the center of whisky production for Scotland, had been hit hard over the last century and had dwindled down to two distilleries - Springbank and Glen Scotia. When the SWA threatened to take away the Campbeltown appellation, Springbank was told a region needed at least three distilleries to consider itself a specific locale. The decision was then made to reopen the long-dormant Glengyle distillery located immediately next door to Springbank. Kilkerran is the name that was chosen for the single malt produced at Mitchell’s Glengyle Distillery because the name Glengyle is already used for a blended Highland malt and they also wished to avoid any possible confusion between the newest single malt to come from the Campbeltown region and a pre-existing blended Highland malt. The flavor of the Kilkerran is a little bit of everything, offering something of a renaissance style which can be described as classically Highland. Very few malts offer so much complexity, while remaining absolutely approachable. The quality of this malt is not to be undersold. It truly represents an authentic expression of the old way to make Scotch and delivers more enjoyment than just about any other whisky for your dollar in the shop. A mixture of 70% ex-bourbon barrels and 30% first and second fill sherry butts. A benchmark malt._There are few more interesting and important whiskies on the shelf than the wonderful Glengyle Distillery malts. The Kilkerran brand has such an interesting story, basically Springbank's big middle finger to the SWA for trying to screw them out of a regional designation, but what's even more interesting than the origin story are the incredible malts themselves. Many of our customers know and love the idiosyncratic malts distilled just down the road at Springbank. The 12 year old Kilkerran is the perfect example of how slight difference in the process can significantly affect the flavor, texture and character of a whisky. This is essentially a slightly less peated version of the same malt that goes into the classic Springbank. It sees a more modern mashing process and a similar, if slightly cleaner, fermentation in traditional Larch vats. The wash is then distilled on the old Ben Wyvis stills, modified slightly to fit in the stone walls of Glengyle and produce the character of whisky that Mitchell was looking for. Tilted slightly up the spirit produced here has some oiliness but also a purity that is that isn't as obvious at Springbank. This is in many ways my perfect malt whisky. The nose billows out of the glass with sweet citrus, mineral/petrol, powerful herbs and deep clean smokiness. On the palate, it's obviously peated, but not acrid and so wonderfully old school. Chewy texture lemon balm, lanolin, chalk mineral, salted stone fruit and ocean spray. Tangy, structured, long, salty and satisfying as it finishes- there's almost nothing out the quiet like this today.

                This single malt is very easy to drink and enjoy. It is creamy, rich and soft with an interesting complexity. It also has a lively and fresh nuance to it that helps make it an exciting addition to our single malt selection.Very good.

                One of only three active distilleries in Campbeltown, this new offering created in the revamped Glengyle is created using old techniques, and the dedication shows. Beautiful white fruit and spice layer the peat, showcasing the uniqueness of Campbeltown. Lovely layers of smoke move throughout this whisky and bring it to a finish with medium heat and spice. Full-flavored yet balanced, this is a cool new offering for those who love every different expression of peat, smoke, and of course, Campbeltown."
1212694,Shinshu Mars Iwai Tradition Blended Japanese Whisky (750ml),"The Mars distillery is very well regarded in Japan despite the low price point. The pot stills used to make this whisky were constructed in the '50s. The fat stills produce a very weighty and complex spirit that delivers a rich texture and complex aromas. Hombo Shuzo, the owners of the distillery, are one of Japan's top wine producers and therefore have access to great number of cask types. Most whisky is aged in sherry and bourbon, but the distillery is also experimenting with wine casks as well. Iwai has a richness and texture that many of the other entry-level Japanese whiskies do not achieve. This unusual whisky is a blend of 65% lightly peated malt, 10% rye grain, and 25% corn whisky. They are aged in ex-bourbon, sherry, wine, virgin French oak, and new American. The whiskies in the blend are aged between 3-20 years of age. The Iwai Tradition is very much a drinker's whisky and offers a lot of pleasure for your dollar. It may not have the cache that the Suntory whiskies have, but it's got every bit as much quality and complexity._NA"

Oban Little Bay is everything that Oban 14 is, and more. A rich, fruity, malty nose showcases dried apricot, dark chocolate, and salt. On the palate, Little Bay explodes with flavor, combining malt with orange, chocolate, and blackberry. Clove and oak spice join the party in the mid-palate, which shows superb balance and integration. A long, slightly dry, citrusy spice finish caps off a stunning whisky.It's not often we see the classic malts of Diageo expand into new releases of their iconic whiskies, but the Oban Little Bay marks that very occasion. Aged in smaller casks to increase the ratio of wood to whisky, the influence is perceptible in the weight of the Little Bay and not so much the flavor . There is no toasty quarter cask flavor, but rather a soft and supple nose of stone fruit and a rounded, mellow mouthful of dried apricots with just a bit of phenolics on the finish. Those looking for bold flavor should look towards Lagavulin or the other Diageo classic malts because this is yet another gentle dram from Oban; as it should be._NA"

It’s powerful, with a thick, buttery feel and a long finish of lip-smacking spice cake and sea brine notes.Somehow this 12 year old—a mix of sherry and American oak—is overlooked by malt lovers heading straight to the mental world of a’Bunadh. This is Aberlour at a crucial point in its growth: you’ve lost the maltiness of the 10 year old, but there’s none of the heavy toffee and licorice of a’Bunadh or older expressions. Here it’s sweet fruits in charge: red apple, black currant, plum. The sherry has added depth, the American oak honey. Length and balance._Aberlour 12 year is a fine little whisky from the tiny distillery in the town of the same name. At this price it's hard to argue with their Double Cask Matured entry level. It's a great alternative to Balvenie Doublewood or even the 'Farclas 12 year each at $10 more than the Aberlour.

The result is luxe and rich, a fine after-dinner sipper. Allow a little time for the aroma to emerge, and a splash of water for maximum flavor. The reward is a thick caramel aroma and flavor, with mouthwatering spicy notes of clove, cassia bark and a hint of orange peel.Following a decade in bourbon barrels, Lasanta is finished for 2 years in oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. Caramel, milk chocolate, and hazelnuts merge on the nose with the spicy dried fruit and orange notes associated with sherry wood maturation. Spicy sultanas, and damsons on the full, sweet palate, with more caramel, milk chocolate, nutmeg, and oak.

Its luscious, soft mouth filling texture, and its deep, enticing, sweet aroma appeals to luxury spirit drinkers who like to experiment, and whose confident choices, warmth and passion inspire the mood of the group. Non chill-filtered and with an ABV of 46%, its key flavour notes are of toffee, raisins and walnuts. Aroma: Like the most delicious dessert menu imaginable, Lasanta taunts the senses with chocolate covered raisins, honeycomb and smooth caramel toffee. Citrus notes clear the way for the crispy burnt sugar and melting softness of crème brulee to be replaced by the rich aroma of rum and raisin ice cream.

If you want a hint of what the legendary but no longer available Black Bowmore 1964 was like, pick up a bottle of Darkest.""_I think the 15 year is probably the most iconic of the standard Bowmore selections because of the extra sherry maturation. The richness really drives home that combination of sweet and peat that makes Bowmore what it is. Campfire smoke, phenolic elements, but ultimately a softer, more rounder mouthfeel. Lovely stuff.

                ""Amber. Whoa. Campfire...peaty fire...suede jacket (nice, not Laphroaig shoe); smoked ham. Some old deli memory, 70s, 80s?"" That was my first impression of the Bowmore 15 ""Darkest"" from a 30cl sample. Later I purchased a full bottle. Initial impressions were consistent: It's a meaty, dry, savory single malt. There's a strong, sherried, rum-raisin component, for sure. There's intensity, but don't expect peatiness like an Ardbeg or Laphroaig. To put it in perspective, I'd say: Dryer and meatier than Talisker 10; may appeal to fans of Glendronach 15 Revival, though smoky; maybe, maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of Lagavulin 16.

It's clear that they're going for balance and easy of entry, but not at complete neglect of character.

But so much more importantly - the whisky inside the bottle is extraordinary. Bottled at cask strength and uniquely finished in 100% Palo Cortado sherry casks from Jerez it highlights the deep citrus and malt flavors of Arran's spirit and its seamless integration with one of the finest, most complex, and rarest styles of sherry Jerez has to offer. The finishing provides the sensational nuttiness and body of an Oloroso combined with the lively zippy saline and varnish characteristics of Amontillado._While I drink nearly all types of sherry gladly and often, if I had to choose, Palo Cortado, in its extraordinary complexity, is my favorite style of sherry to sip and savor. Ill-defined and hard to pinpoint exactly what makes a P.C. sherry, it offers the best of what  Fino, Amontillado, and Oloroso have to offer in a unique and ethereal wine. It's hard enough to find a decent selection of more common sherry styles in this world, but Palo Cortado can be especially difficult to hunt down on the shelf. The rarity of it means there are precious few casks that make their way to Scotland for whisky maturation. Fortunately for us, when they do, the results can be spectacular. Under the watchful eye of MacTaggart...James MacTaggart...this whisky expresses everything you could hope for in the combination of Arran's fruit and malt forward spirit and the world's most underappreciated wine. It's impossible to dissect whether the robust citrus notes on the nose come from the malt or the finishing. It's a breathtaking combination of candied satsuma, burnt orange peel, grapefruit freshness, and lemon zip. Mix that with a sultry nuttiness clearly provided by the cask and you've got a nose you can sniff for hours. The palate is mouth coating, but not thick. It highlights the oxidative side of the P.C. without losing the freshness of its time under flor. A very different experience compared to Oloroso aged or finished whiskies. Like many of Arran's cask strength whiskies, a little bit of water brings out a sweeter profile. It shows a wide array of candied and dried stone fruits and a toasted sweet spice. The finish goes on and on. If oxidation had a taste separate from the thing that had oxidized, I think this would be it. It's very pleasant, but also a bit unusual.

1307825,"Highland Park ""Valkyrie"" Isle of Orkney Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","The Highland Park Valkyrie is the first in a three-part limited edition ""Viking Legend"" series. This time they're going back to their roots and including a significantly higher portion of their exquisite floor-malted barley. That means you get the unique Orkney peat character that is so rare today. The typical Highland Park has less than 25% of the heavily peated malt, but this new expression boasts at least 50% of the Orkney peated stocks in the blend. In collaboration with Danish designer Jim Lyngvild, whose ancestor was the Earl of Orkney, the packaging is a nod to the history of the Viking soul of the island, which had been in Viking hands for nearly six hundred years before the Scottish annexed it in 1468. And before the influx of Norse settlers, Orkney had been part of the Pictish kingdom. This nod to the history of the island on the outside of the bottle hints at the historical distillate inside. Very well received by critics, this is easily one of the best new releases from HP in a long time. The review from the Ultimate Spirits Challenge: ""Elegant and intriguing aromas of freshly baked multigrain bread, smoked salt and tart dried peaches abound on the nose. Powerful in the mouth, the sweet and soft flavors of stone fruit give way to baking spices, vanilla, and smoked bulgur wheat. The finish is lengthy and complex.""_Having recently tasted through the lineup of Highland Park I was pleased by how consistently good they remained, having not tasted them in years. Then a week later we received in the new Valkyrie and I was excited to try a brand new expression from them after having so much fun revisiting the others in their line-up. The new Valkyrie in no way disappoints. A rich creamy nose resplendent with almond, vanilla and the smoke of a just started campfire that is just beginning to waft into the air mingle together. A lovely rich and creamy palate has a cooler smoke element with ripe fruits and soft creamy caramels and a dash of baking spice. The heat builds but does not overwhelm as the spice leads the way on the finish.

                I'm predisposed to dislike releases like this one. Fancy new bottle, danish design partnership, etc. But, as it turns out this is really well put together new product. An absolutely delicious example of why own floor maltings make better whisky and a reminder of why Highland Park remains one of the highest quality distilleries on the market. Today a tiny percentage of the whisky we drink is produced using barley that is malted at the same distillery. This age old practice of drying barley is extremely expensive and time consuming. Since 95% of all malt is used in blended whisky the cost and consistence advantages of using industrially malted barley are crucial to the success of that industry. But, what you gain in efficiency and consistency you may forfeit in complexity. With the new Valkyrie, they've taken the venerated malt dried with special Orkney peat and unleashed it's potential in a way unseen in modern bottlings of HP. The result is something extremely pleasurable.  Matured in a combination of first-fill American oak sherry, bourbon, and Spanish oak sherry butts as well as a selection of refill casks, which regardless of the lack of age statement have been married to create one of the best malts for your dollar available in the store right now. That Orkney peat is so unique, much more underbrush and earthy campfire than the Islay salty brine and the cask selection for this one was clearly excellent. Big nose of sweet fruit, candied citrus, and smoldering chaparral. Creamy rich textured and balanced with the sweet American oak playing perfectly with the smooth smokiness of the Orkney peat. The finish is long and soft and satisfying. A truly fun and somewhat didactic offering that nearly any scotch lover will appreciate. 
            |
                The nose is reminiscent of the sea breeze blowing hard across the deck of a ship. A raging fire has burnt out on the distant shore. Tart, like the bite of a crisp apple; fresh, and yet sweetly rounded. Stone fruits and pears also blossom on the palate. It’s beautifully golden in color, mellow, and ever so easy to drink. Vanilla and spice abound and lingers for days stitched together seamlessly with a gentle peat. A remarkable feat in the NAS sub-$100 category. Top marks.

                Highland Park's new Valkyrie edition, much like its previous releases, is long on viking mythology and short on specifics, but that doesn't mean it doesn't taste good. I did a side by side comparison with the 12 and 18 year this week and felt that—as a middle ground between the two—the whisky holds up quite well for the $70 price. More importantly, it tastes like the best parts of both. While the 12 year is light and fruity, the classic 18 year is remarkedly more sherried. With the Valkyrie, you get the malty, lightly-peated texture of the 12 with some of the rancio, cakebread, and richness of the 18. From what I understand, about half of the barley used in the Valkyrie was peated, which is higher than what's used in the 12 and 18. That extra kick helps to mask any rawness from the whisky's younger components and was clearly a good move. What I appreciate most here is that the Valkyrie delivers its finest work on the nose and the finish, rather than on the mid-palate. These are two elements of whisky appreciation I appreciate more as I get older: how it teases my nostrils and how it comes together as a unit on the back end. There's a robust sherry aroma right out of the bottle, and sweet, concentrated hit of Oloroso richness on the finish that dries out a bit with the smoke, but clearly makes itself known. While Highland Park went heavier on Orkney's viking heritage this time around, they didn't do so at the expense of the whisky."

1261931,Suntory Toki Japanese Whisky (750ml),"While it may seem that our world is suddenly awash in Japanese single malts, the fact is that we’re already in a shortage. Last year, as demand continued to build for its limited stocks, Suntory took the age statement off its Hibiki, suggesting less of the precious older stocks were being used. This year, they’ve introduced Toki, a welcome addition to the portfolio. Whereas Hibiki is a burnished, complex sipper, Suntory’s latest release, Toki, is a light, bright, perky spirit with a surprising punch of flavor—apple, citrus and honey notes backed by a lingering smokiness. It makes an elegant summer whisky served on the rocks, but it also seems destined to usher the return of the whisky highball, which has become the drink of choice in Tokyo these days. It’s very refreshing when made as they do, stirred over rocks in a tall glass, then joined with super-bubbly soda water and a lemon twist.This is a handy core ingredient for many cocktails, combining single malts from Yamazaki and Hakushu with grain from Chita. Dying embers of burnt heather and aromas of sliced apples browning through careless neglect. A complex interplay between the smoky embers, roasted spices, tiger fruit, coriander, and whole peppercorn precedes a sweet taste of buttered popcorn, orchard fruit, and burnished orange, supported by increasingly provocative pepperiness. Quaffable and versatile.This blended whisky from Japanese powerhouse distiller Suntory is specifically formulated for a classic highball, made by mixing one part Toki with three parts sparkling water and serving over ice. From the distillery: ""A vivid blend of whiskies from Suntory’s Hakushu, Yamazaki, and Chita distilleries, Suntory Whisky Toki features the quintessential characteristics of a Suntory Whisky blend: exquisite balance, harmony, and oneness. At the same time, its unique pairing of Hakushu American white oak cask malt whisky with Chita heavy-type grain whisky overturns the traditional hierarchy between malt and grain. These seemingly dissimilar but deeply accordant whiskies, together with select Yamazaki malts for additional depth and complexity, gives Suntory Whisky Toki its silky taste, vivid character, and bold inventiveness.""_When the Suntory Toki first launched at $45, it was a bit of a stretch because of how hot the market was for Japanese whisky. I'm much more comfortable selling this in the mid-thirties, however, and with our new pricing we can do that. While you sip on your bottle of Yamazaki or Hakushu, you pour this one on the rocks, add some soda water, and make yourself a real mizuwari--the great whisky soda that dominates Japan's drinking culture. The fruitiness on the nose really blossoms with the addition of bubbles, so don't be shy here. Do Japanese whisky right and drink it how it's intended!
            |
                I, like so many others, really like a lot of what Suntory has to offer. There are so many wonderful whiskeys they put out, unfortunately many of these have gotten super expensive and rare. Fortunately, they are trying to fill in the gap with a more everyday whiskey, and the Toki is just the product to do that. A lightly fruited nose reminiscent of caramel apple and vanilla leads to a smooth and somewhat fruity whiskey. Baked apple and stone fruit notes are rounded with touches of vanilla and a somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Low heat finish rounds out the delightful little whiskey."

A convoluted profile winds through vanilla, sugar cubes, and honey fudge, followed by pear, apricot, and a gentle crescendo of spice, before hitting a plateau of honey, breakfast cereal, nougat, and white chocolate to finish.The history of the excellent Mars Distillery is long and complicated. The special stills that now sit at the high altitude distillery near Nagano were hand-built to the specifications of the preeminent grandfather of Japanese whisky, Masataka Taketsuru. In the 1950s, Taketsuru-san's mentor Iwai Kiichiro, who had commissioned his famed voyage to Scotland, designed and built two pot stills for Hombo Shuzo in Yamanashi using Takesturu's original specifications. The stills were moved to Kagoshima not long after production started and eventually moved again to Nagano in the early '80s. For another decade, Mars Whisky operated their old pot stills from their mountain home, but lackluster demand for whisky caused Hombo to cease operations completely at the plant in 1992. But renewed interest in the late '00s for Japanese whisky compelled the owners to relaunch the brand and recommission the old pots at Mars Shinshi in Nagano. Now Mars Whisky consists of two distilleries, this one and another at the Mars headquarters on Kumamoto called Tsunuki. Production is tiny compared to their next largest competitors, Suntory, and Nikka, but Mars' single malts have become renowned for their extremely high quality._NA"

Although the alcohol level is palate-numbingly boozy, the flavors are interestingly complex and dry, showing cocoa, leather and espresso.Balcones's award-winning Texas whiskies are suddenly heavily sought-after, perhaps none more so than their single malt whisky. With a deluge of flavor, this dram shows rich malty notes with heavily toasted char and even a bit of Burgundian red fruit on the finish. It has a basic character of traditional Scotch whisky, but then meanders into a completely unexplored realm. At 53%, the flavors are bold and brash — not unlike Texas itself!_I would seriously never have considered a Texas single malt whisky unless it was sitting in front of me, nearly daring me, saying, hey, I dare ya. What a surprise. A surprisingly developed aroma of roasted walnut, with a deep, darkly sherried palate that reminds me a little of, say, the Cragganmore 23, but with cinnamon spice, too--not in a bourbony way. This rich, dark single malt may be not quite as complex of some of our older, nutty Scotch single malts, but it is a really great effort from the single star, I mean the Lone Star state."

He says, ""Nose: Pretty near perfect HP for its age, and one of the best examples of the distillery of that era I have nosed for a very long time. Slightly above average peat for a HP, which works perfectly in its favour. The usual heather honey has been skewed slightly by the heady mix of tannins and peat. The saltiness is profound, the oak a rich, spicy backbone. The sweetness is subtle and still honeyed, but more now a blend of Manuka and orange blossom. Truly magnificent! Taste: Scotland's silkiest malt at its most silky. The bold smoke on arrival is caught in the velvet gloves of the lightly oiled barley sugar, a dark liquorice sweetness spreading as the oak makes its mark. The spices are prim, proper and just so, never moving out of their set orbit while the honey starts to make its long-awaited mark, bringing with it the light smoke; a quick surge of exotic fruit underlines the antiquity with aplomb. Finish: Long, increasingly smoky with the spices still teasing and forging a beautiful duet with the molassed sugars... Balance: This is a malt whisky coming to the end of its life, like a star becomes a white dwarf In density is huge and I mean gigantic. The oaks are about to explode, but the cask has been bottled in the nick of time where the balance is still near perfect. Fine margins…for a very fine whisky.""_NA"

Adam Hannett has crushed the ball out of the park, off the island, and into the sea with this one. Typically I'm not a huge fan of red wine cask whiskies, but there have been a few releases over the years that have caught the attention of my palate. I had a sneak peak at this beauty when wandering the warehouse with Mr. Hannett back in the Spring of 2018. There is a veritable treasure trove of casks from Bordeaux's top producers hiding mere feet from the edge of Loch Indaal. These casks represent the first time I've been truly excited for red wine finished whiskies to come to market. While the MRC:01 first hit shelves in the US last year, we only received a minuscule amount of product at that time. The peculiarities of different markets has somehow meant that a sizable portion of this rare release has found its way to CA in the middle of 2020. Finally some good news for the year! The peat is intense - the nose smells like you're walking through the rubble of a burned down malting facility combined with a BBQ pitmaster's best cherrywood smoked brisket. Add to that the salt air of Islay, dazzlingly deep ruby red fruits courtesy of MRC's finest Bordeaux, and you have a complex powerhouse. The all Scotttish Barley stands up strong against all this peat and wine. It's easy to see how a lesser malt would simply be lost here, but at the generous ABV of 59.2% everything lines up just right. Whether it's Bruichladdich itself, Islay in general, wine finished whiskies, or all of the above that you love, this bottling is not to be missed any aficionado or collector."

The fat, wide stills produce a very weighty and complex spirit. Mars always delivers a rich texture and complex aromas. The special pot stills were moved to Mars' Nagano facility and repaired in the late 2000s. They were refurbished again in 2014.

1182146,"Kilchoman ""Machir Bay"" Islay Single Malt Whisky (750ml)","It's no secret that we're big fans of Kilchoman distillery here at K&L. Our recent visit to the distillery on Islay really opened our eyes to the incredible job they're doing. Kilchoman is a tiny operation, producing on one still and malting whatever they can inside their humble barn. Because of their small scale, cost of production is higher and prices for their whisky have not been inexpensive. But having tasted the new-make spirit right off the still, we can firmly say that, in our opinion, there is no higher quality peated whisky being produced anywhere else. Kilchoman's hands-on style and attention to detail make a world of difference. Every release has been better than the last, albeit extremely limited in supply. All that said, this small farm is finally introducing a full-time, affordable house recipe, rather than another pricey single-barrel release. The Machir Bay is not only incredibly delicious, it's a huge victory for a distillery that had to overcome huge obstacles. At $54, this is what Kilchoman fans have been waiting for: incredibly delicate, finely-tuned flavors of soft smoke, sea salt, creamy vanilla and butterscotch. It's a more subdued version of their high-toned barrel expressions, but it's still very much Kilchoman. Think Bruichladdich meets Lagavulin. Think possibly best whisky value from Islay._As an avid fan of Islay whisky, I was thrilled with the quality and value of this bottle.  Although a young whisky, this still delivers the characteristics you would expect from the region ranging from peat to the natural elements of the island.  It has an extraordinarily soft mouth feel along with a smooth and delicate finish despite delivering the initial smoke and brine flavor.  This would be a great introductory bottle for those considering a move into the world of Islay.

                Many are aware of our affection for this wonderful new distillery on Islay. This, being their entry level product, deserves to be a benchmark. If nothing else it should provide a wonderful education for any Islay lover. What happens when you put Ardbeg spec barley into steel fermenters and Kilchoman's tall little still? Add an ultra fine heart cut and a thoughtful wood management program and you've got truly soulful whisky that's still Islay in every way. Proof positive that great whisky need not be old. Zesty and full of oceany brine, the peat at this age stands up and smacks you right across the face. Sweet malt and mild rancio notes whisper in, but one does not forget the rugged shoreline just below the farm where this whisky was distilled. A pleasure, to say the least."

Gentle malty notes come through initially, accompanied by apple core and classic ‘Farclas weight. The alcohol, though high, is not obtrusive. In time there’s some orange marmalade, and this bittersweet element helps to add another layer of complexity. Water brings out toffeed depth. Even neat it isn’t too hot, showing heft rather than bludgeoning power. In time there’s black cherry, chocolate, and a hint of smoke. Highly recommended.This is the Big Daddy of Glenfarclas. At 105 proof, it is almost like having two different malts. This malt is big and hot with rich, round flavors. Add a splash of water and it smooths out and becomes softer with a nice long finish._NA"
1010986,"Macallan ""Triple Cask"" 15 Year Old Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","This is my favorite of the three. For about $20 more, you get a richer, much more complex whisky than the 10 year old, and it is more balanced than the 21 year old. This 15 is drier than the 10, with lovely floral and spice notes_NA"
1488756,Hellyers Road 15 Year Old Tasmanian Single Malt Whisky (750ml),"Hailing from Northern Tasmania and distilled from 100% Tasmanian malted barley this 15 year single malt was aged in American oak and vatted together in large wooden tanks before bottling. It has not been chill filtered and was bottled at 46.2%ABV. It's a lovely golden whisky laden with citrus and vanilla tones and possessing a buttery smooth texture. This is plainly one of the best ""world whiskies"" in the store._A stunning whisky. The nose peaks in a glorious bouquet of citrus flowers and fresh squeezed juice. The mouth feel is much broader than expected, cereals fill the palate rich, earthy, and nutty all at once. The aftertaste is sweet and lingering with a piquant sense of ginger and lemon grass. It's buttery and wholesome and all around delicious."
1428925,Old Pulteney 18 Year Old Single Malt Whisky (750ml),"Loaded with chocolate and spice the 18 year from Old Pulteney drinks like a sea salted chocolate bar with candied citrus peel. It's warm, rich, and smooth. A littel honeyed malt sweetness balances the dark chocolate and sea breeze that is the hallmark of this dram. This follows the same age regimine as the new 15 year - ex-bourbon followed by first fill sherry olorosso finish._NA"
1426425,"Starward ""Two Fold"" Double Grain Australian Whisky (750ml)","Starward strikes again. The long awaited follow up to the stunning Nova Single Malt has hit the United States.

The result is a high quality and consistent whisky that marries the best of creamy wheat distillate with a fantastic single malt. It drinks something like a cross between bourbon and Scotch, but that's not quite right - it's all its own and completely Australian._NA"

620022,"Macallan 25 Year Old ""Distillery Bottling"" Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","An intense candy treat of a whisky that announces itself with rose petal, honey and hard candy on the nose. On the palate this cycles through a number of candied notes-fruity for the most part, with cherry character, but including butterscotch and a slight pine forest flavor. The long finish serves as another tour of the palate, with a nutty element. Sherry casks.Extremely limited! Macallan's 25-year-old sherry casks are a modern classic. From the distillery: ""The Macallan Sherry Oak 25 years old forms part of our Sherry Oak range which features a series of single malt whiskies matured exclusively in hand-picked sherry seasoned oak casks from Jerez for richness and complexity...

620112,Glendronach 12 Year Old Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml),"Aged in former American whiskey casks, then finished in barrels that previously held PX and oloroso sherries, this single malt balances sweetness, spice and oak. Caramel and vanilla aromas are echoed on the velvety palate, plus cocoa and espresso, finishing with clove, cinnamon and a hint of lemon peel.Nicely sherried. Rich, with maple syrup, honey-drenched citrus, sultana, and a good dried oak spice finish for balance. Well done for a 12 year old, and definite competition for Macallan of the same age.Glendronach was one of our favorite distilleries on our recent trip to Scotland and this 12 year is the best whisky that no one is drinking. Soft, supple, rich, and complex, and finished in PX sherry butts for a kiss of sweetness. This is my new house whisky and I can't recommend it highly enough. It's not going to blow your mind, it's just really really really good. It's what you wish every Speyside malt could taste like._This whisky just keeps getting better, in my estimation. Rich and sherried, reminiscent of summer and winter treats: caramel apples and roasted, candied nuts. The Glendronach 12 has spicy, rum-raisin aromas, roasted nuts--filberts, Brazil nuts--and baked apple and pear notes, which repeat on the palate, so cotton-candy smooth, and the fruit flavors deepen toward the dry, smoky finish. Similar to: Aberlour 16. More flavor than: Glenlivet 12. Fiercer, less smooth than: Macallan 12 or Glenmorangie 10. More easygoing but in a somewhat similar profile to: Glendronach Allardice, Aberlour A'Bunadh. A standby, a classic. UPDATE: I have tried the Glendronach 15 Year Port-finished edition, a really svelte, nice dram, for sure, but I STILL prefer the 12 Year. If you like rich, nutty, sherried single malt, you really ought to try the Glendronach 12."
1479337,"Wolves ""Winter Run"" American Whiskey (750ml)","An eclectic blend of whiskey distilled from beer, as well as rye and malt whiskeys; it proved divisive among Whisky Advocate’s blind tasters. The nose is resinous, with pine needles, biscuity malt, macadamia nuts, grapefruit oil, and tropical fruit. Oily on the palate, with assertive hops, pineapple, brown sugar, nuts, bread dough, and reticent spice. The finish is floral, hoppy, and pleasantly savory, with nuts, grapefruit, and lemon. This whiskey knows exactly what it is—unconventional—and it’s not afraid to show it.Distilled by 13th generation Master Distiller, Marko Karakasevic in Ukiah, CA. Using his antique alambic still, Marko has become famous for excellence in distilling and particularly the art of distilling finished beer. The super slow and long distillations create a superior spirit filled with texture and richness. Each tiny batch takes over 10-days to complete, sleeping in four hour shifts, and manned by hand. He personally decides where each cut is made and selects ‘the heart of hearts’ for each second distillation. The Winter Run is a blend of California whiskies distilled in that famous still imported from Cognac. The blend consists of finished craft stout distilled and aged in French oak for 8 years, distilled craft Pilsner beer aged in new American oak for 5 years, a spicy rye whisky and a single malt whiskey distilled from two-row malted barley aged in used French Oak for 9 years.

The stunning distillery combines Scottish tradition with state of the art technology to exercise the utmost control and consistency over the distillation process. The pure Apline waters and wide temperature swings make this an ideal place for whisky production. The end result is a range of whiskies that have racked up many gold medals and high scores from numberous publicatios and competitions. The Sole bottling has been aged first in ex-Bourbon casks and then sees equal time in Pedro Ximenez casks before bottling. Notes from the distillery: ""Sole means 'sun' in Italian and reflects two crucial stages in Sherry making. After harvesting, the grapes are dried under the hot Spanish sun, concentrating their sweetness. The wine from these grapes is then aged for many years in frequently changing oak casks. This ancient maturation method is called solera.""The taste is distinctively sweet with strong notes of honey and blood orange, that are counterpointed by creamy flavours of walnut and spicy oak._NA"

Entry is the most complex of any whisky; midpalate soars on oak, spirit and grain tastes. The greatest distilled spirit of this generation. Buy whatever you can find.Introduced to the Highland Park portfolio in 1997. Gentle peat, soft toffee, floral notes, and honey on the beautifully fragrant nose. Superbly balanced on the velvety palate, with brittle toffee, stewed fruits, peat, honey, and a hint of coffee. Smoke and more toffee mingle in the long, elegant finish.Highland Park 18 Year Old is an exceptionally fine whisky that builds on the world-class reputation already enjoyed by the 12 Year Old. All the Orcadian hallmarks of Highland Park are here--the smokiness, the peat, the heather-honey--plus it has gained a glorious richness and spiciness through its longer cask maturation. Its elegance and smoothness make the 18 Year Old a delight to the malt whisky connoisseur. One of F. Paul Paccult's Designated Top Scotch Whiskies ._The nose gives up nutty, toffee, honeyed heather and baked bread aromas with a subdued smokiness. The smoke comes out more distinctly on the palate, balanced by full, sweet flavors of honey, caramel and spiced baked apple. This is a spirit that seems wild at first encounter, but is really surprisingly gentle at heart, with a sweet generous nature lurking behind the not entirely slick exterior. I should also note that the finish reverberates for a goodly span."

This very young Bunnahabhain is much more gentle than the average Islay, without the use of peat dried barley, but offers subtle aromatics and a interesting oceany quality. The exceptional price and unique qualities of this cask are first intrigued us, but the amazing price reduction is what sealed the deal. If you're looking to better understand the old unpeated malt from the north shores of Islay, this is a must try. F. Paul Pacult give this fun young whisky the following review, "" ... This opening nosing is rife with fresh-off-the-still flowery scents ... as well as deft touches of sea salt and damp grain ...

1029712,Bowmore 18 Year Old Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml),"This 18 year old is aged in a mix of bourbon barrels and oloroso sherry casks. The nose is redolent of a damped-down bonfire, with stewed fruit, wood spice, and pipe tobacco. There are red berries, subtle peat, a hint of iodine, and soft oak on the complex palate. The finish yields more tobacco, oak, rich peat, and spicy dark chocolate.Complex and contemplative. The enticing scent mixes iodine, sea breeze and salted caramel, while the light, soft palate shows smoke, cocoa and dried fig notes, drying to clove and black pepper sparks. Water softens the overall impression to mocha and spice, with a mild blanket of campfire smoke on the exit.Bowmore 18 Years Old Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky has just been voted the ""Best in Show Whisky"" at the San Francisco Spirits Competition, one of the foremost drinks competitions in the world. It was also awarded a Double Gold medal.

The new release Cream Sherry Cask Finish continues this run of wonderful and thrilling limited editions from one of the Highlands' most underrated distillers._I have long been a fan of Deanston's sherry selections since I cut my teeth on a 10 year-old Pedro Ximenez finished bottling of theirs. What that release lacked in complexity this makes up for several times over. Unmistakable whiffs of Oloroso on the nose - roast walnut, dried fruit and woody syrup - perfectly frame Deanston's earthy malt. Dark fruit and healthy spice abound, wrapped up in the caramelized sugars of the cream sherry. Not as dessert-y a dram as one might expect, this alludes more to the nutty character of Emilio Hidalgo's Morenita than to the Bristol Cream from Grandma's cupboard. It's a serious sherry finish for a serious whisky, though with a satisfyingly sweet finish. Delightful to drink."

Black currant holds sway on the tongue, yielding to caramel, ground ginger, a second burst of juicy blueberry, with a hot finish evoking strips of dried tropical fruit and flashes of ground pepper. Rewarding and flavorsome.After so much time spent merely reading about the great single malt whiskies from Taiwan's Kavalan distillery, we can finally get our hands on them here in the states! The Concertmaster is aged in ex-Bourbon casks for the first three years of its maturation, before being transfered to Ruby Port pipes for an additional year of finishing. The integration is flawless and perfectly balanced -- there's enough malty texture from the Bourbon maturation with just enough red-fruited sweetness to round out the edges. It never tastes gimmicky or overdone. It's somewhere between the Glenmorangie Quinta Rubin and the Balvenie 21-year. The Concertmaster is less decadent than the Balvenie, but has more chocolate and cocoa flavors than the GlenMo. Lovely. It's the humid conditions of Kavalan's warehouse that allows the maturation to take place much faster -- and while I'm normally skeptical of such accusations, the proof is in the pudding here.

Settles into a toasty cinnamon graham cracker note at the end. Bourbon and Sherry casks.Extremely limited quantities available! This is one of Campbeltown's best values, especially when you consider that the 21 year retails for upwards of $600. This is one of Scotland's most exciting distilleries and is independently owned. It is essentially a mandatory purchase for all of those single malt obsessed, if for no other reason than to gloat about actually owning one.

This then adds chewiness to the palate, balancing the dry nuttiness and receding on the finish where those green fruits come through to add fresh acidity. Great balance.Gold Medal winner in the 2007 International Wine & Spirit Competition. The Glenfiddich 12 Year is distinctively fresh and fruity with a hint of pear on the nose.

1458703,Cut Spike Cask Strength Nebraska Single Malt Whiskey (750ml) (Previously $60),"At first we couldn't believe our mouths. We knew that Cut Spike single malt had just taken Double Gold honors at the 2014 San Francisco Spirits competition , so obviously other people thought it was good, too. But after tasting so many mediocre American attempts at single-malt whiskey, we had become accustomed to the idea that the Scottish style of distillation would never be recreated here at home. There would be spin-offs, and experimental grasps at greatness, but that supple, malty profile would simply be something we needed to import from abroad. Then the folks at Cut Spike sent us a sample of their two-year-old Nebraskan single-malt whisky made from 100% malted barley on a pot still crafted in Rothes, Scotland. Fermented at the brewery next door to Cut Spike in La Vista, the malt was matured for two years in new American oak with varying levels of char. The result is an incredible hybrid: soft, barley and vanilla-laden whiskey that tastes somewhat like your standard Scottish single malt, but has its own unique character at the same time. It's the kind of whiskey you taste once and enjoy, but then the next day suddenly crave intensely. It impresses you instantly, yet doesn't really reveal its full character until weeks later. The new oak blurs seamlessly into the malty mouthfeel, adding a richness on the finish normally not tasted in standard Scottish selections. Cut Spike is a major accomplishment for American distillation, pure and simple._More directly fruity on the nose than the Small Batch release, this Cask Strength then displays some more medicinal notes and a slight mustiness before giving way to wood and wood spice. The palate is rich and full with an excellent mouthfeel, not too thin and very mouth-coating. There's a burst of sweetness that gives way to more savoriness and spice with a mid-palate salinity. This is really starting to showcase the depths that an American Single Malt Whiskey can bring, providing a complexity and color that might lead you to think this is older than it is."
1166155,Kavalan Classic Taiwanese Single Malt Whisky (750ml) (Previously $80),"When the news arrived that a distillery was being built in Taiwan, the whisky world pretty much dismissed it. When Kavalan appeared at a precocious 42 months, it sat up and took notice. Owned by food and beverage conglomerate King Car, Kavalan started producing in 2006 with blender Ian Chang at the helm — and a hotline to consultant Dr. Jim Swan. Taiwan’s tropical climate pushes the maturation cycle along at a ferocious rate, but the key here is its complexity. Maybe it’s auto-suggestion, but I could swear there’s ginseng in here, as well as honeycomb and black cherry pie filling. Fresh and clean, the spirit is rich and accompanied with great wood. Mature whisky in three years? It’s an accountant’s dream!After so much time spent merely reading about the great single malt whiskies from Taiwan's Kavalan distillery, we can finally get our hands on them here in the states! The first release from Kavalan was their classic single malt expression that uses ex-sherry, ex-bourbon, and ex-wine casks of between four and four and a half years of age for the marriage. The first thing that strikes you as you taste it is how un-youthful it is. It might as well be a 12-year-old malt from the Scottish Highlands, but with an incredible supple-fruited character. The malty character, the stone fruits, the accents of vanilla--they're all there, round and supple, but there's something just a bit different going on from the classic Scottish profile. It's the humid conditions of Kavalan's warehouse that allows the maturation to take place much faster, and while you might normally be skeptical of such claims, the proof is in the pudding here.

Since 1797 the distillery has been making malt in the northeasterly town of Oldmeldrum, near Aberdeen._The Glen Garioch distillery is one of Scotland's oldest and most legendary. Their flagship 12 year old remains an absolute classic. This distillery has been through a few owners and several stylistic changes in the last 40 years, but as stalwart steward for the Eastern Highlands style it has no equal. One thing that always amazes me about modern Glen Garioch is the opulent cereal qualities it's malt exhibits. Malted oats, sweet grain, floral honey and an attractive leafiness. On the palate some citrus, more grains, soft round texture added by the higher proof and some flinty pepper notes. Some water and the orchard fruits come out. A wonderful distinctive Highlander that should be considered a benchmark for any Scotch lover."
1473301,"Kilchoman ""Machir Bay"" K&L Exclusive Vatting Batch #3 Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml)","It's no secret that we're big fans of Kilchoman distillery here at K&L. Our recent visit to the distillery on Islay really opened our eyes to the incredible job they're doing. Kilchoman is a tiny operation, producing on one still and malting whatever they can inside their humble barn. Because of their small scale, cost of production is higher and prices for their whisky have not been inexpensive. But having tasted the new-make spirit right off the still, we can firmly say that, in our opinion, there is no higher quality peated whisky being produced anywhere else. Kilchoman's hands-on style and attention to detail make a world of difference. Every release has been better than the last, albeit extremely limited in supply. All that said, this small farm is finally introducing a full-time, affordable house recipe, rather than another pricey single-barrel release.

1375506,Port Charlotte 10 Year Old Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml),"Distilled from Scottish barley, this is the first permanent age-statement Port Charlotte bottling. First and second-fill American oak and French wine casks were used for aging. Rock pools, lemon juice, caramel, but little overt peat on the nose. The palate boasts big orchard fruit notes, smoky coconut, and brine. Again, the peat is quite muted. Long and spicy in the drying, peaty finish.The first permanent release of Port Charlotte 10 Year. Apparently, they've got enough whisky to keep this going awhile. We certainly hope so 'cause it's just fabulous. It replaces the multi-vintage Scottish Barley they've sold for years. The new, distinctive green glass bottle distinguishes the Port Charlotte label from the unpeated Bruichladdich line and wonderfully captures the raw power and awesome complexity of the special smoky whisky from west bank of Loch Indaal. As with the previous offerings, the 10 year is 100% Scottish barley grown in the Invernesshire region. Peated to 40 ppm and aged in 65% first-fill American whiskey barrels, 25% second-fill French wine casks and the difference in second-fill American whiskey barrels. As with all Bruichladdich products, it's bottled on-site without coloring or chill-filtration of any kind. Cut with Islay spring water to a gorgeous 100 proof, this permanent addition to Bruichladdich's portfolio also represents a new edition to the pantheon of spectacular, affordable, and available peated Islay malt whiskies. It stands shoulder to shoulder with its peaty cousins to the south and east. Expect big, dry, ashy peat balanced with sweet fudge and melting brown sugar. On the palate, tangy BBQ smoke, zippy smoked lemon peel dusted with a hefty layer of baking spice. The powerful smoke is tamed by a vibrant wild honey and lifted, salty oyster shell. It moves toward ripe baked tropical and orchard fruits on the end. Perfectly seamless._NA"
1199224,Westland Peated American Single Malt Whiskey (750ml) (Previously $70),"Seattle’s Westland Distillery may be the country’s foremost producer of American single-malt whiskey, especially considering its most recent releases. The Peated blends a heavily peated spirit with a mash of fruity, grainy Washington-grown pale malt to give a whiskey with the smoky snarl of peat that’s elegantly tucked into a smooth, harmonious drink.The peated version of Westland’s Seattle-born single malt is modestly smoky on the nose but more intensely smoky on the palate, underpinned by vanilla and caramel.By distilling a highly-peated single malt whisky and marrying that with an entirely unpeated single malt whiskey, Seattle's Westland Distillery has created something magically delicious, more akin to Talisker or Springbank, rather than Ardbeg or Lagavulin. The smoke and phenolic elements are definitely present, but never detract from the soft, oily fruit and the inherent creaminess of the spirit, which are definitely the stars of the show. Imagine everything you love about Longrow or Bunnahabhain, but in a different package and distilled in the Pacific Northwest, and that's the Westland Peated in a nutshell. A major accomplishment for North American distilling._The Westland Peated Single Malt tastes like it is from somewhere else and commands a much higher price tag. Seriously, this whiskey is good. While the comparison to a distiller like Springbank is apt, this is also it's very own spirit that is not pretending to be anyone else. Peat and a touch of brine comingle with some chewy fruit and layered with smoke. The finish is a little spicy but the heat dissipates quickly while leaving the flavor and a sense of happiness for having tasted such a delightful whiskey. 
            |
                In the spectrum of American single malts, Westland is at the apex of my list.  Each and everything they offer is of incredible quality and reasonably priced.  Their peated whiskey, priced at $69.99, rivals most Scotch whiskeys that command upwards of $100.00.  It's rich, focused and balanced, showing notes of smokey creme brulee, vanilla, pie crust and scorched orange peel.   Easily one of the best American whiskeys on the market today.
            |
                In a serious line-up of some of the most detail oriented, authentic tasting, and yet wholly original non-Scottish, Scotch style single malt whisky, the Peated Single Malt from Westland especially impressed me. It has noticeable yet balanced peat smoke, coupled with a chewy, viscous, downright delicious flavor and texture that reminds me of Springbank. You should absolutely take notice of this name; they will be a big deal soon but remember where you heard about them first!
            |
                MAN, this is delicious. It's like an American version of Talisker or Springbank in terms of richness and oiliness, but it has its own fruity, malty character that helps it stand out from the pack. Soft stonefruit, creamy vanilla, earthy undertones, soft campfire smoke, rich malty sweetness on the finish. This stuff is already the total package. I can't wait to see what the future holds for Westland. By the end of 2015, they'll be the talk of the country."

Almond and pecan wind into a long, drying finish laced with ginger, lemon zest and white flowers.This very delicious and enigmatic blended Japanese whisky from one of Scotland's adept bottlers sells out around the world in minutes. We're lucky to have access to these special stocks but can't say much about the source as the bottlers are contractually prohibited from disclosing their source. The bottlers DO, however, imply that this whisky is distilled, aged and blended entirely in Japan and therefore represents a style of whisky that is all but extinct on our shelves. Whether or not this was distilled 100% in Japan is second to the fact that it's absolutely lovely. Big nose of malt and fruit, subtle peatiness, candied ginger and vibrant finish that is the hallmark of the great Japanese blends. It's sad to say, but this just might be the poor man's Hibiki 21, considering that product is now trading for upwards of $700. From the bottler: ""Japanese whisky. Maybe you've heard of it. Maybe you've heard that it's pretty bloomin' marvellous. Maybe you're excited that we've only gone and bottled our first whisky from Japan!

1150963,"Charbay ""Release III"" Hop Flavored Whiskey (750ml)","Double-distilled from Pilsner beer, flavored with hops and aged for 14 yearsThe magnificent Charbay whiskey is back for round three. This legendary distillate is without a doubt one of the best American whiskeys ever produced. It's designated hop-flavored whiskey because it was distilled with hoppy beer, and for some reason hops are added after distillation as well. No one knows why, but all we can say is it's the work of a mad genius. Anyone who dismisses this product because of this funny classification will lose our sympathy along with one of the best drinking experiences available. Totally unlike anything else on the market, the legend started with a tanker full of pilsner from the closed Sonoma Mountain Brewery, a beautiful alembic still, and a skilled distiller. Six years in new, charred Missouri oak, and eight further years in stainless steel, and a supernatural concoction was born. This stuff was magnificent at two years old and to experience the progression of this whiskey throughout the years is mind-blowing. A truly special and uniquely Californian whiskey.

Combining Indian malt and Scottish peated malt, this whisky shows a sweet side, but is never cloying, with rich caramel, vanilla custard, and fruit cocktail in light syrup, balanced by vibrant -- almost floral -- dried peat smoke, delicate white pepper, and a hint of tropical fruitThis Indian single malt is so named because it's made with 'a fusion of Indian and Scottish barley.' The aroma is deliciously fresh, suggesting crisp apple slices. It's silky on the palate, showing plenty of caramel followed by a billow of peat smoke. It finishes dry, with an intriguing mix of cigar tobacco, leather, Baker's chocolate, bitter orange peel and spice. At 100 proof, it's predictably hot; be prepared to dilute it to taste.Does the first Indian single malt to hit the U.S. shores actually live up to the hype? In our opinion, yes! This is a fantastic blend of grainy sweetness, rich barrel vanilla, and smoky peat all wrapped into one unique and interesting whisky. While the Amrut Fusion incorporates elements from both Islay and Speyside, it really tastes like neither one. There is a more rustic character that stands apart from the smooth and polished Scottish malts, but yet the dram itself is still balanced and well crafted. This is a milestone for the international whiskey market that in time will stand up next to other outstanding non-Scottish malts like the Yamazaki 18. You will be pleased._NA"

White it has its trademark un-peated malted barley taste, the Ledaig brand represents the peated side of single malt from the island. Ledaig’s character owes it’s quality to many sources:  the traditional 18th century distillery, the maturation for the full 10 years in superior oak wood casks , the dark and aromatic lochan water source situated high on the mountains, the malted barley that has been exclusively peat dried, and the 43% alcohol by volume that complements the smokiness of the palate perfectly.  This is a many-layered masterpiece.  Ledaig 10 Year Old tasting profile:  Color: A bright lemony gold. Nose: Immediately pungent with sweet tar and creosote aromas that release wood smoked fragrances with hints of liquorice and leather. Palate: Sweet, smoky flavors with an explosion of spicy pepper, then boasts a savory salty maltiness. Finish: Liquorice and cloves combine into a medium length smoked pepper finish.  An ideal balance of peat, smoke and wood. Sweetness: 6; Peatiness: 9._I was a Scotch drinker in my 20s, but for some reason that I can't remember, I stopped drinking them. After being around David Girard for awhile, he became sort of a ""mentor"" to me, and I am having a lot of fun being reintroduced to the world of Scotch. The Ledaig has been, so far, one my my favorites, with a very balanced amount of peat (which I love), and a quite intriguing whiff of white flowers, leather and lots of spices. I will keep you posted about this exciting journey with other reviews."

Honey, apricot and crème brûlée kick into a spicy ginger and black pepper finish and a gentle puff of smoke.This unusual French Single Malt has been raking in the awards over the last year. It started with a wild vision and some dumb luck, but when Allison Patel discovered this small grape grower in Cognac, who happened to plant organic barley in between his vines, she new she'd found something special. A lover of whisky, the farmer/distiller made whisky in his alembic pot still for his own personal use, but when Allison got a hold of him she new they had something special. Using organic barley, the whisky is first aged for more than 3-5 years in new French Limousin oak before being transferred into freshly used cognac casks for a further 3-4 years of aging. This is bottled as single barrels at the classic cognac strength of 40%. The resulting product is unlike any other. A distinctly French whisky that will appeal to bourbon, cognac, and malt drinkers alike. From the Beverage Testing Institute: ""Clear gold color.

1458705,Cut Spike Maple Syrup Barrel Finished Nebraska Single Malt Whiskey (750ml) (Previously $60),"From the producer: ""With a mission to deliver artisanal, handcrafted spirits, Cut Spike Distillery released its first whiskey in 2012. Single malt whiskey was our motivation to buy stills from Scotland and begin producing great American single malt whiskeys. But our passion for distilling did not stop there; vodka, rum, brandy and small batch spirits are all produced at our distillery.""_All right, this is a weird one, in the best of ways. I thought that the maple syrup barrel would impart a directly maple experience, but instead it's totally thrown me through a loop. The maple finish seems to have imparted an incredibly floral and slightly funky nose with super ripe peaches and whiskey-soaked raisins and a light almond hint accompanying the more typical barrel spice and vanilla. The palate is noticeably quite sweet but with a funky sort of medicinal fruity sweetness instead of a direct maple, reminding me of a botrytized wine. The finish is lingering and ends on the dry side with a grassy and grainy note buried underneath the still sweet palate. I'm not going to lie, this is a weird one and will likely be polarizing, but if you come at it with an open mind and an open palate, you might find your next after-dinner sipper."

620036,Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml),"Along with Cragganmore, this is one of the underrated members of the original Classic Six. Quite why has always slightly baffled me. OK, it isn't smoky, but the nose has a deep, soft, honeyed sweetness: think caramelized fruits, hints of thick cream, and a light touch of fennel and sharp citrus. Thick in the center and very gentle, it's that chunkiness in the middle that is the secret to its beauty.Opening aroma is assertive, dry, with peppery scents of barley husk, grainy oil and cracked wheat wafer; seven more minutes bring out a mildly sweeter, slightly vanilla bean, brown rice-like side. Palate entry is pleasantly prickly, textured and moderately sweet; at midpalate, the taste profile turns stunningly sappy and resin-like. Finishes dry to off-dry and keenly resiny.If you're looking for a Highland malt, then the Dalwhinnie is for you. This spirit is totally unique: it is the only distillery that is allowed to use the spring water that flows from Lochan an Doire-Uaine, and it has the soft grassiness of a Lowland malt with the firm character of nearby Speyside. Notes of heather and peat on the nose, with a delicate, honeyed citrus palate with vanilla and anise accents that is soft and lingering. Satisfying._Dalwhinnie 15 year is one of those wonderful malts that tends to turn non-Scotch people into whisky fanatics. The lightly peated malt of Dalwhinnie is aged to perfect maturity in their excellent 15 year offering and certainly deserves its place in the Classic Malt portfolio. The beautiful distillery produces a fruity style that shows no signs of peat on the nose by the time its 15 years old. Instead, expect toasty oak, amber honey, floral oils and baked apple. The palate is rather sweet with the tiniest hints of smoke popping out at the end. Malty and fresh, this is easy-drinking stuff with plenty of character behind that sense of overt pleasure."

620031,Dalmore 12 Year Old Highland Single Malt Whisky 750ml,"Half the whisky was aged in bourbon barrels, the other half in sherry casks. This whisky has always been on my short list as one of the finest, most affordable 12 year old single malts available. While the price may have gone up a bitOpening whiffs detect scents of toasted cereal grains and biscuit batter; air contact stimulates deeper aromas of peanut butter, buttered popcorn, wheat toast and lanolin. Palate entry is sweet, maple-like and sappy; the midpalate features oily flavors of roasted nuts, sautéed butter and nougat. Ends on a nutty, near honeyed note, with a trace of cigarette tobacco.The Dalmore malts are not sweet, peaty, or soft.  They are powerful, masculine drams distilled by a pot still with a special flat head to help add a more robust flavor.  The 12 year is a medium to full-bodied smooth malt, golden in color.  Half the blend is aged in sherry and the other half in bourbon. The nose is intense with sherry overtones and dried fruit.  The taste is complex with touches of wood and a long, lingering finish with spicy notes.  A fantastic whisky._NA"

1165481,The Last Drop 50 Year Old Whisky (750ml) (Previously $4000),"Would you have gambled The Last Drop 1960 liquid in new sherry wood for four more years? The indulgent nose proffers maple syrup, buckwheat honey, roasted spices, blue grapes, pomegranate, raspberry compote, cilantro, pandan leaf, and beefsteak juices soaking into mushroom gills.

Water brings an oily nuttiness, then further drops produce a silky, clingy texture. Glorious. Miraculous. Victorious.This is a blend. Not just any blend. More than 82 whiskies went into the original marrying vat, 50 years ago, many from distilleries long closed and forgotten.

1452031,1968 The Last Drop Glenrothes Cask #13504 Single Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml),"Charles Maclean’s Tasting Notes…Cask No. 13504.“Amber with long-lingering beading. A mellow nosefeel, with slight prickle after a while.

A drop of water enhances the wood notes. A smooth texture and a sweet taste, drying in the spicy finish, with a suggestion of Friar’s Balsam medicine and a cooling mentholic aftertaste. ”_NA"
